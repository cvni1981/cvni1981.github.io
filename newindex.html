            <p>Hi! Welcome to my bit of the web where i put stuff i like, stuff i do and other things too. (hey that rhymed)<br>
                I... don't know how to explain or express this place exactly. It's got places you can go that have stuff in them you might want to look at. Basically.<br>
                Making this website has been a very fun (and challenging) experience, including learning html and css, and i hope you like having a gander at it, however small this site may be.</p>
