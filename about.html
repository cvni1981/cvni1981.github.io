        <p>Hi there! This website is kept up and made by a group of ppl, going collectively by <b>cvni81</b>
            on the web. Yeah not that good a name but. eh. There used to be a doodle here but it's not
            very accurate, given yk. multiple ppl. So have this dingus guy. If we feel like it we'll put
            names indicating who's doing what! The one you're reading was made by <b style="text-decoration: underline dotted #00966c 2px;">turquoise</b>, hi :3
            We all like a bunch of stuff, old TV IDs, flags, fonts, design, old coins, history, prob other stuff i'm missing.</p>
        <p>I spend most of my time watching YT vids, as you do, as well as playing around on Inkscape
            and Blender and Jummbox making doodles and music, as well as listening to music (you can see what
            we listen to on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1tqpqbcrw16yda1b4kc4nuu92" style="--color: green">spotify</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/cvni81" style="--color: crimson">last.fm</a>!). More rarely, coding in python and making drawings. I really should do that more often tbh</p>
        <p>We live in Brasil, speak Portuguese natively and English... almost natively h as well as
            a neat constructed language called <a href="https://tokipona.org/">toki pona</a> that has only 120 words that i super duper
            recommend learning. We're also working on a font for its writing system which we'll put
            here in a room sometime soon!!!</p>
        <p>Also, we're <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index" style="--color:black">anarchists</a>. 
            As in ppl ruling over other ppl is Bad no matter who does it. Also as in
            antiracism, anticolonialism, feminism, all the good stuff. The world sucks. So we'll try to
            do our part in making it suck less for everyone, no exceptions.</p>
        <p>Gender-wise, we all have different genders obvsly so asking pronouns is the best bet,
            but <b>they/them</b> works for all of us :3</p>
        <h2>about the website</h2>
        <p>This website started off as a carrd, prob in 2021, that doesnt exist anymore. too limiting. We then moved to
            neocities, but it has a file limit. Github repositories don't have limits so're here since july 2022.<br>
            Bc we're indecisive and out tastes change with time, this place's been remade 8 times if i'm
            not mistaken. I want(ed) this site to be simple, but still interesting and different.
             Very soon i realized i had to put stuff in this website, so i put texts and
            drawings, but this place itself became a reason for it to exist, yk? to experiment with different colors
            and fonts, making each room different. Because it's nowhere in particular. It also feels p open with few borders.
            <br>And i wanted to make this place feel real, corridors and rooms and boards, instead of some void 
            generated by servers at github bc. it feels fun.
