        <p style="margin: 0">Hi there! Um... im. not that used to talking about ourselves but i'll try!<br>
            I go by cvni81 on the web, this is a place where i put a bunch of things i do.<br>
            Over time i've had a bunch of interests, like old tv IDs, flags, design, collecting old coins and stuffs, drawing, making <a href="blender/">things in blender</a>, making dingus music in jummbox sometimes, and researching things when i feel like it sometimes.<br>
            We discovered toki pona in. maybe 2021? It's a neat language that's very easy to learn, and we very very sometimes write in it, as well as in english and portuguese (my native language).<br>
            We listen to music a bunch, often focusing on one song or one album at a time. If you wanna see what we listen to (at least on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1tqpqbcrw16yda1b4kc4nuu92">spotify</a>), check out it and our <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/cvni81">last.fm</a> in the links on the homepage!<br>
            Oh yeah, and coding ofc h We like to code in python and pygame bc. it's easier. I've also gotten a bit into manim again, but idk how long it'll last h<br>
            We're currently in university doing biology but. idk how long i'll stay in bio bc. I just like everything! Or maybe i'll just. drop out. idk what time holds for me :3<br>
            Oh and. I Want to do stuff involving social justice, antiracism and anarchy and and political things but. My social weirdness and anxiety dont really help with doing things irl. I try i guess (???)<br>
            Regarding gender uh. It's weird. nonbinary ig! Ask pronouns but they/them works.<br>
            If you wanna chat with me, i'm absolutely open!</p>
