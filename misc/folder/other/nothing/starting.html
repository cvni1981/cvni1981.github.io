    hello there fellow internet enjoyer.
    <br>nice to have you here. very nice in fact.
<br>
    <br>just earlier today i had another idea to redesign the site completely, with a black background (again) and this time based on <a href="https://csslayout.io/circular-navigation/">this circular design</a>.
    <br>which gave me anxiety, because it hasn't even been a single month since i redesigned this site for the 5th time, if i'm not mistaken.
    <br>in fact, this reminded me of the whole purpose this site once had: a place for me to make something pretty, no matter how much different or simple or complex it was.
    <br>and... it kinda lives on in the few differently styled pages. but not much.
    <br>and i've questioned whether this whole thing of different pages having different styles was a good idea.
    <br>...even though other sites like <a href="https://nyanseong.neocities.org">nyanseong.neocities.org</a> does this, and very well might i add.
<br>
    <br>i suppose every page has their uniquenesses.
    <br>...uniquenesses. that's a lot of s's.
    <br><i>ahem</i> anyways, this website.
<br>
    <br>it's grown. i don't know really how much it's grown but it has grown.
    <br>and i've never really liked the idea of keeping a blog, probably because i'd forget about it like i've forgotten about this whole website several times...
    <br>but, alongside the circular design idea, i had another idea for a list layout that i realized could work for a blog! it's simple and effective.
    <br>i guess that's what this whole site is about, using little simple things and making the most out of them.
    <br>and i don't really know how well that's worked tbh.
<br>
    <br>...what am i even rambling on about...
    <br>i guess this blog should start somewhere, and semicoherent ramblings about this site and others seems like a good place to start.
    <br>one thing that i've learned from making this site is about accessibility.
    <br>i already had miniscule experience with typography but <i>just</i> enough to know that some fonts and color combinations are more legible than others.
    <br>some times the legibility has taken a back stand to looks but, overall accessibility is one of the main goals of this site.
<br>
    <br>the moment it hit me straight in the head was mobile compatibility and responsive layouts.
    <br>very very big thanks to <a href="https://ctrl-c.club/~nat/">natalie</a> for teaching many things about this, but before i didn't know the @media rule, em units, min() and max() and many other things that i'm probably forgetting.
    <br>probably because the way i learned CSS and HTML was just looking up videos and documentation and basically brute force.
    <br>i guess i just like figuring out and doing things myself.
    <br>if it worked, it was good enough, good coding practices be damned.
    <br>mobile just wasn't in my mind when making this site.
    <br>but with the latest redesign i made it mobile-first (mostly), so that it looks at least decent on mobile.
<br>
    <br>i guess that's a strength with simpler layouts, it's more maluable.
    <br>uhm...
    <br>i suppose this is it for now.
    <br>if you want to see more about how this site was made, you can have a look at the misc <a href="website/misc/folder">folder</a> and <a href="website/misc/journal">journal</a>.
    <br>these are the main places where i'll be talking about this site.
    <br>this blog is meant to be about other stuff i like. if i ever feel like talking about it here.
    <br>and i suppose this site is just a place for me to put pretty things i think look nice to the world. maybe someone else likes it too.
<br>
    <br>ok it's time to finish this off. thank you for reading this far!
    <br>have a good day!
