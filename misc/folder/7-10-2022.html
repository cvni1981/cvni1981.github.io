            Hey.<br>
            What's up.<br>
            I'm.. ugh...<br>
            Ok, let's get this straight, i'm not feeling very good about this website.<br>
            You could probably tell by all the things i write in the journal.<br>
            And i think i've figured out why.<br>
            <br>
            I feel this site is too... different.<br>
            But too bland at the same time.<br>
            Y'know?<br>
            Like-<br>
            The whole way it's stuctured, with the sidebar...<br>
            And then this whole misc thing being completely separate...<br>
            But at the same time, there being only a few basic colors.<br>
            And the fonts changing every page.<br>
            Heck, even this dumb thing that for some reason is its own thing has a font that isn't used ANYWHERE ELSE on this site.<br>
            There isn't a style.<br>
            <br>
            But i've also come to think that...<br>
            Maybe that's just how it is!<br>
            There isn't one style. That's the style!<br>
            Everything in this place is a bit different, has its own vibe, feelings...<br>
            Also i like how simple it is.<br>
            It's mostly text with some images sometimes.<br>
            Simple but effective.<br>
            Maybe even a bit too simple.<br>
            <br>
            What matters most to me is that it's unique.<br>
            It's my website.<br>
            I made this.<br>
            Not to sound selfish, of course but...<br>
            I'm...<br>
            I'm-<br>
            I-<br>
            <br>
            Ugh...<br>
            I'm just saying this as self-feedback because...<br>
            I've never really gotten any real feedback.<br>
            Anything i'm doing wrong.<br>
            I'm in the dark.<br>
            Maybe i'm worrying too much. Maybe my site is great.<br>
            Maybe it isn't.<br>
            But i know i shouldn't worry about these things because they're dumb! They're dumb!<br>
            If i ever get any feedback, change accordingly but..<br>
            If you haven't got any, you don't have to worry so much!<br>
            JUST MAKE IT!<br>
            <br>
            ...<br>
            This felt kinda good to write!<br>
            A little vent.<br>
            heh.<br>
            Outing this out into nothingness feels good.<br>
            Even if...<br>
            No one will probably read it.<br>
            Maybe...<br>
            Maybe i'll even dedicate another place here to these!<br>
            Yeah...<br>
            <br>
            <i>*sigh*</i><br>
            <br>
            Also I'm sorry i've had to make you scroll through my rambling just to get to the go back link.<br>
            But i suppose i wanted you to read this.<br>
            You can go now.<br>
