    <h1>about difference in general</h1>

    <p>
        Difference is an important thing. It's what keeps the world going round, it gives life spice, it makes existing fun.
        <br>It'd be boring if everyone'd be the same, if nothing new happened each day, wouldn't it?
        <br>Why question and shun and fight differences instead of embracing and accepting them?
        <br>
        <br>All are different, but not unequal; everyone is human, and thus deserve to be treated as such, with love, food, shelter, freedom of thought and expression, all the good stuff.
        <br>Aside from that, everyone is different in many ways; ≠ country of origin, ≠ age, ≠ weight, ≠ gender identity, ≠ color of skin, ≠ religion, a bunch of stuff.
        <br>
        <br><i>But none of that matters. Because we're all people.</i>
        <br>
        <br><b><i>→ Everyone is equal and different, but not more or less than anyone else.</i></b>
        <br>
        <br>A bit confusing, but i hope you get it.
