        <p>You step into the narrow corridor, now lit by a light blue light, nicer than the harsh green;
            there are doors to the sides, each to a separate project. Besides each door is an explanation
            of each.</p>
        <h2>difference</h2>
        <p>A very old page i keep since the old versions of this site; kind of a manifesto to kinda show
            the importance of difference, not to separate us, but to be together whilst understanding our
            different existences. I might redo this someday
        </p>
        <h2>blips</h2>
        <p>Short poems taking advantage of html to make them more interesting. <i>Currently not mobile-
            friendly.
        </i>
        </p>
        <h2>weather</h2>
        <p>A crappy weather app that shows way more information than one would need. It uses wttr.in to get
            the data, and it also doesnt save anything on your device (you can check 
            <a href="weather/weather.js">the (crappy) js code</a> yourself if you want, it's my first, could you tell)
