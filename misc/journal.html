            Hello again!<br>It's been a while since the last update, though i've been changing some bits of the site every now and again...<br>
            But ever since i changed the style off the sidebar thing, it's gotten quite stagnant.<br>
            I guess that's better than the frantic changes i used to make to this site.<br>
            It's what i wanted it to be!<br>Now for figuring out new things to put here... I'm thinking about making pages or "shrines" about
            specific colors i like. Maybe something will come from that. Maybe not! I don't know.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>25/10/2022 15:27</h2>
        <p>
            I forgot to add this when the change was made yesterday, so i'm doing it right now.<br>
            Yeah, i'm not doing the thing from the last entry.<br>
            Instead, i made it simpler.<br>
            Less words at the start and got rid of the sidebar (just by removing the border and background in the css file).<br>
            And... I actually kinda like it. Wow.<br>
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>6/10/2022 21:43</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! Welcome to another episode of...<br>
            THIS WEBSITE SUUUUUCKSSS<br>
            This time, I want to change the layout again <b>again</b>, to something more... normal? I suppose?<br>
            Something with sidebars, something like this:<br>
            <img src="/website/misc/folder/newidea.png" style="width: 250px"><br>
            And put the sitelog right on the index page.<br>
            I have no idea when this will be done, but it's another step towards me thinking the website is decent.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>28/9/2022 21:38</h2>
        <p>
            I felt like making a couple english things today, and now they're here!<br>
            And i had to change nimi mute to <a href="/website/words">words</a>. Everywhere.<br>
            Also i found that you can make links shorter, so i did that to all pages.<br>
            ...until i found that pages within folders broke.<br>
            So i decided to reset it all and aaghhh it took much more than it had to.<br>
            But it's done now yay!
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>26/9/2022 17:13</h2>
        <p>
            Alright! It's all done now. I changed all the pages to the new sidebar style.<br>
            Also, I kinda wanna make this journal a bit less... chunky.<br>
            But I don't know.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>25/9/2022 20:51</h2>
        <p>
            Alright. I'm done "porting" everything to the new style with the sidebar.<br>
            Only thing left is removing the brackets in the doodle gifs because they don't fit in anymore.<br>
            But that's tomorrow.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>24/9/2022 18:01</h2>
        <p>
            Ok, so. I'm still making the front page, i think it's done now.<br>
            But i'll probably have to take the site off to re-start it all at once.<br>
            I'll add a sidebar to every page, except the misc ones.<br>
            It'd ruin the rpg vibe thing, i think.<br>
            Oh and move <a href="/website/difference">difference</a> to the archive. It's a bit off for the site's vibe.<br>
            But then it's perfect for the site's vibe. Eh. I think putting a manifesto right upfront isn't a good idea.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>23/9/2022 21:10</h2>
        <p>
            I feel like remaking the whole site.
            <br>Something like this maybe (but white instead of green of course (or maybe even some gray ooh))
            <img src="/website/misc/folder/idea!.png" style="height:250px"><br>
            <b>(22:31)</b> Alright i did <a href="/website">a little bit</a> but it's getting late again, so it'll have to be finished tomorrow.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>22/9/2022 14:50</h2>
    <p>
        To-do:
        <ul>
            <li>make this book into an actual book (it'll take learning on click and some javascript)</li>
            <li>make the folder into something more interesting than a list</li>
        </ul>
        <br>No guarantees it'll all be done today though. Making websites takes time.
        <br><b>(16:23)</b> I instead put each entry into its own container. Not a whole book, but still a big improvement in my opition.
        Also changed the links in the entries to dark green instead of gray for contrast.
        <br><b>(20:12)</b> I have made a <a href="https://cvni81.123guestbook.com/">guestbook</a>! If you feel like giving me feedback, i'd be super super happy to hear it, good or bad.
        It was originally supposed to be a thing where you could write at the end of this notebookbook, but i don't want people to have to go through a maze of links
        just to give feedback.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>20/9/2022 21:46</h2>
    <p>
        So... I kinda wanted to add a website visitor counter to this, so i can tell if someone's actually coming here.
        <br>But many solutions just counted visits and just reloading uppded the count, and ones which counted separate visitors
        required tracking the visitor's IP address which i DEFINITELY do not want to do.
        <br>So... I guess i'm staying in the dark.
        <br>Also i kinda want to make this look like an actual book, or with pages or something.
        <br>But that's tomorrow.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>19/9/2022 18:02</h2>
    <p>
        Now the miscellaneous page is like a text-only rpg! sort of... Why not?! This whole basement thing is already all over the place.
        <br>Someday i'll put the phrases into actual sticky notes, who knows?!?!
        <br><b>(19:04)</b> I did it yay
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>17/9/2022 12:36</h2>
    <p>
        I renamed the handdrawn page to <a href="/website/doodles">doodles</a>.
        <br><b>(17:00)</b> Idea: make header gif thingies that are slightly different and random everytime someone loads the page.
        <br><b>(17:11)</b> I'M DONE!!!! I've separated all the doodles into categories, this took so longg, all the gifs...<br>
        But i'd say it was worth it.
        <br><b>(17:35)</b> After some nitpicking, i'd say i'm... satisfied with how it turned out. The colors didn't work well with the grid, 
        especially the cyan.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>16/9/2022 20:21</h2>
        <p>After snooping around for some cool websites to put in my <a href="/website/buttons">buttons</a> page and
            looking at other's websites, i think my website is lacking animation.
        <br>Things like gifs, they make the experience more... interesting than just boring, still text.
        <br>I'm working on adding more drawings to <a href="/website/doodles">handdrawn</a> - it'll probably be done by tomorrow - 
        and one of the things i'm adding are animated buttons to different categories (just 3 though).
        <br>Also on the plans is adding more drawings to the other misc pages like this one and maybe even animate them.
        <br>I think this is a big step on making my site look less... boring i guess.
        <br><b>(22:04)</b> Renamed this page from "paragraphs" to "basement journal", because that's basically what this is.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>15/9/2022 22:05</h2>
        <p>I don't know if i should keep the entrance to here a bit hidden
        <br>or make it more obvious.
        <br>If someone's been upstairs they probably didn't even come down here.
        <br>Which, i don't know if it's a good thing or a bad one.
        <br><b>(22:15)</b> I made the entrance more obvious now.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>13/9/2022 15:43</h2>
        <p>I now realize i'm spending a lot more time here in the basement than upstairs.
        <br>But i guess that's a good thing! I'm being a lot more creative here, where i'm not bound to just one style.
        <br>Here i can make whatever i want and it'll fit, because it's the basement.
        <br>But... I'm kinda sad that upstairs is remaining relatively unchanged.
        <br>I guess when i make some new text in toki pona or blender render or button or something that <b>fits</b> the style of upstairs, i'll put it there.
        <br>Also i think i have to make a button, i know this site already has a bunch of buttons, but none of them <b>works</b> as a button.
    </p></div>
