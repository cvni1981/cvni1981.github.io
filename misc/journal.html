            Hi!!! It's still not done...<br>
            Today i've finished the {doodles} page, and that's when i hit a wall:
            either make the page more accessible by changing the colors and redoing the gifs AGAIN or,
            even worse, remove the gifs entirely, or just leave it as is.
            I decided to do the latter!<br>
            Ever since when i started this other redesign, i felt like a big company ridding the site
            of all its life, all the fonts, the gifs... so i found a compromise!
            Use 2 fonts (or 3 if i decide to keep Space Grotesk for the misc pages), one sans serif (Work Sans)
            and one serif (Crimson Pro)!<br>
            Hopefully tomorrow i'll finish the whole thing and add a bunch of stuff to the folder, 
            like another rereredesign when i fully gave up and tried to remake the site from scratch
            with minimal images! ...only to come crawling- nay, running back to this! This site's rendition of an
            April Fools joke-<br>
            This is what the site is supposed to be! It's nowhere in particular, each page has it's own feel, it's
            FUN!!!<br>
            I swear, i've never felt this good after a redesign, it almost always feels like a step in the wrong
            direction, this doesn't!! Hooray!<br>
            I'll try to add more doodles, maybe some renders, i've done a bunch of them without adding them here, 
            aaa i'm so excited! I love and hate this site at the same time.<br>
            I need dinner.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>30/3/2023 19:50</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! It's not been a month this time<br>
            One thing i realized about the design on mobile is it's basically impossible to
            hit the little triangle in the navbar to see the rest of the sites on the list!
            I tried, as you can see in the misc page, to just separate the home link from the
            (more) details thing, but it's clunky and it doesn't alight properly when the details 
            tag is open.<br>
            Also, i realized this would be really time consuming to add to ALL the pages. Also also, i found
            a new favorite font, Work Sans! So i'm rerere[...]designing the site with only that one font,
            having only the colors change.
            I'm doing this because it kinda connects the pages a bit more, it lets me use the same
            css file for (almost) all pages with colors being done separately and, more importantly, it's
            less data the phone/computer has to keep to display the page properly, which is a problem
            that my friend Natalie also talked to me about.<br>
            I'm done up to the words section, by tomorrow i'll (hopefully) have finished everything!
            Also i'm taking this as a chance to make the colors WCAG compliant (having a 4.5:1 contrast ratio),
            or at least the ones i can without adding another color to the scheme.
            ...this was a big entry wow
        </p></div>

            Hi, it's me from the last's entry's future and your past. I'm done adding the sidebar!
            I also wanted to change the homepage back to the old version with a sidebar, but idk
            how that'd work exactly on mobile without things having to scroll.<br>
            So yeah! I'll be able to sleep well tonight. If you find anything i did wrong please
            please please PLEASE tell me<br>
            alright, i'll see you in a month

            Hello again!
            <br>...i'm redesigning the site again. But not completely this time! I'm readding the whole
            sidebar thing this used to have, but now with the light mode and not looking terrible on
            mobile!
            <br>I've done all but the websites, the words and the homepage. I'll do these tommorow bc my
            head is already too fried :%
            <br>Also i might change some colors here and there for better readability and accessibility
            and things.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>6/2/2023 14:33</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I just got done with rereredesigning the whole site! The 4th time actually!<br>
            This time, i changed the main style to light mode, more inviting than the dark mode thing 
            we had before, but (kinda) still as slick!<br>
            Also, a big improvement: it doesn't suck on mobile anymore!<br>
            I learned how to make things designed with mobile first in mind instead of desktop like before.<br>
            And i tried my best making it look decent, even on my crappy phone with Firefox, which apparently is worse than
            Chrome for some reason :3<br>
            If you have any quibbles about it, i'd be happy to hear at my discord (@cvni81#4837)!<br>
            Also big thanks to a new friend, <a href="https://ctrl-c.club/~nat/">Natalie</a>! They helped me with feedback for the site!

    <div id="home" class="entry"><h2>2/2/2023 12:28</h2>
        <p>
            AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhello there<br>
            It's been a long long long time since i've done anything creative or... useful with this website.<br>
            So today i decided to do that. By changing the layout of the site again.<br>
            I tried to make the sites like that dumb zine I talked about last year, with 2 rows.<br>
            As you can tell, it didn't work. And like the entIRE REST OF THE SITE-<br>
            ... sorry<br>
            Like the entire rest of the site, it looked like absolute crap on mobile.<br>
            We really need to learn to do that...<br>
            And i started with a welcome page like so many other homemade websites have...<br>
            You can still look at it if you want.<br>
            I didn't use it because it doesn't mesh well with the rest of the site, the handdrawn thing gives it a cozy, homey feeling,
            which this website ABSOLUTELY does not have.<br>
            I didn't bother saving the other sites because i stopped early at... 3 pages.<br>
            ...ugh... This website's dead isn't it.<br>
            """"home""""...<br>
            I just don't have anything to add to this dumb site!<br>
            I don't write often, i'm not doing blender renders much anymore, all i can do is add some doodles that look like crap.<br>
            Sorry for rambling.
        </p></div>
    <div id="zine" class="entry"><h2>1/12/2022 12:56</h2>
        <p>
            Hey uh<br>I know it's a bit late, this was a thing that happened like<br>a week ago<br>maybe more<br>
            but i remembered to do it now so i'm doing it now.<br>
            I wanted to do a zine, yknow<br>like a magazine but small and indie and stuff<br>
            But it hit me unsurprisingly quickly that<br>i don't really have any good ideas for things to put there.<br>
            And i wanted to reuse a thing that already was in the words section, yknow the jan poem. yeah<br>
            It even had some pictures, i'm...<br>I'm kinda proud of it.<br>
            It also had a thing about botany? But i... It's not good. It's just-<br>
            I know, i know, i have to work on the site more...<br>
            Look, it's...<br>I just don't know what to do with that thing!<br>
            <a href="folder/zine/0">Here you go</a>. It's not got the biology part because...<br>
            I'm not particularly proud of that one...<br>Yeah you know.
            It's in the folder too if you wanna take a look there.<br>
            And i might do something with that jan poem. I don't know.<br>
            Alright, stay safe. Alright, bye.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>7/11/2022 21:27</h2>
        <p>
            Hello again!<br>It's been a while since the last update, though i've been changing some bits of the site every now and again...<br>
            But ever since i changed the style off the sidebar thing, it's gotten quite stagnant.<br>
            I guess that's better than the frantic changes i used to make to this site.<br>
            It's what i wanted it to be!<br>Now for figuring out new things to put here... I'm thinking about making pages or "shrines" about
            specific colors i like. Maybe something will come from that. Maybe not! I don't know.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>25/10/2022 15:27</h2>
        <p>
            I forgot to add this when the change was made yesterday, so i'm doing it right now.<br>
            Yeah, i'm not doing the thing from the last entry.<br>
            Instead, i made it simpler.<br>
            Less words at the start and got rid of the sidebar (just by removing the border and background in the css file).<br>
            And... I actually kinda like it. Wow.<br>
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>6/10/2022 21:43</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! Welcome to another episode of...<br>
            THIS WEBSITE SUUUUUCKSSS<br>
            This time, I want to change the layout again <b>again</b>, to something more... normal? I suppose?<br>
            Something with sidebars, something like this:<br>
            <img src="folder/newidea.png" style="width: 250px"><br>
            And put the sitelog right on the index page.<br>
            I have no idea when this will be done, but it's another step towards me thinking the website is decent.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>28/9/2022 21:38</h2>
        <p>
            I felt like making a couple english things today, and now they're here!<br>
            And i had to change nimi mute to <a href="/website/words">words</a>. Everywhere.<br>
            Also i found that you can make links shorter, so i did that to all pages.<br>
            ...until i found that pages within folders broke.<br>
            So i decided to reset it all and aaghhh it took much more than it had to.<br>
            But it's done now yay!
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>26/9/2022 17:13</h2>
        <p>
            Alright! It's all done now. I changed all the pages to the new sidebar style.<br>
            Also, I kinda wanna make this journal a bit less... chunky.<br>
            But I don't know.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>25/9/2022 20:51</h2>
        <p>
            Alright. I'm done "porting" everything to the new style with the sidebar.<br>
            Only thing left is removing the brackets in the doodle gifs because they don't fit in anymore.<br>
            But that's tomorrow.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>24/9/2022 18:01</h2>
        <p>
            Ok, so. I'm still making the front page, i think it's done now.<br>
            But i'll probably have to take the site off to re-start it all at once.<br>
            I'll add a sidebar to every page, except the misc ones.<br>
            It'd ruin the rpg vibe thing, i think.<br>
            Oh and move <a href="/website/difference">difference</a> to the archive. It's a bit off for the site's vibe.<br>
            But then it's perfect for the site's vibe. Eh. I think putting a manifesto right upfront isn't a good idea.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>23/9/2022 21:10</h2>
        <p>
            I feel like remaking the whole site.
            <br>Something like this maybe (but white instead of green of course (or maybe even some gray ooh))<br>
            <img src="folder/idea!.png" style="height:250px"><br>
            <b>(22:31)</b> Alright i did <a href="folder/index.html">a little bit</a> but it's getting late again, so it'll have to be finished tomorrow.
        </p></div>
    <div class="entry"><h2>22/9/2022 14:50</h2>
    <p>
        To-do:
        <ul>
            <li>make this book into an actual book (it'll take learning on click and some javascript)</li>
            <li>make the folder into something more interesting than a list</li>
        </ul>
        <br>No guarantees it'll all be done today though. Making websites takes time.
        <br><b>(16:23)</b> I instead put each entry into its own container. Not a whole book, but still a big improvement in my opition.
        Also changed the links in the entries to dark green instead of gray for contrast.
        <br><b>(20:12)</b> I have made a <a href="https://cvni81.123guestbook.com/">guestbook</a>! If you feel like giving me feedback, i'd be super super happy to hear it, good or bad.
        It was originally supposed to be a thing where you could write at the end of this notebookbook, but i don't want people to have to go through a maze of links
        just to give feedback.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>20/9/2022 21:46</h2>
    <p>
        So... I kinda wanted to add a website visitor counter to this, so i can tell if someone's actually coming here.
        <br>But many solutions just counted visits and just reloading uppded the count, and ones which counted separate visitors
        required tracking the visitor's IP address which i DEFINITELY do not want to do.
        <br>So... I guess i'm staying in the dark.
        <br>Also i kinda want to make this look like an actual book, or with pages or something.
        <br>But that's tomorrow.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>19/9/2022 18:02</h2>
    <p>
        Now the miscellaneous page is like a text-only rpg! sort of... Why not?! This whole basement thing is already all over the place.
        <br>Someday i'll put the phrases into actual sticky notes, who knows?!?!
        <br><b>(19:04)</b> I did it yay
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>17/9/2022 12:36</h2>
    <p>
        I renamed the handdrawn page to <a href="/website/doodles">doodles</a>.
        <br><b>(17:00)</b> Idea: make header gif thingies that are slightly different and random everytime someone loads the page.
        <br><b>(17:11)</b> I'M DONE!!!! I've separated all the doodles into categories, this took so longg, all the gifs...<br>
        But i'd say it was worth it.
        <br><b>(17:35)</b> After some nitpicking, i'd say i'm... satisfied with how it turned out. The colors didn't work well with the grid, 
        especially the cyan.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>16/9/2022 20:21</h2>
        <p>After snooping around for some cool websites to put in my <a href="/website/buttons">buttons</a> page and
            looking at other's websites, i think my website is lacking animation.
        <br>Things like gifs, they make the experience more... interesting than just boring, still text.
        <br>I'm working on adding more drawings to <a href="/website/doodles">handdrawn</a> - it'll probably be done by tomorrow - 
        and one of the things i'm adding are animated buttons to different categories (just 3 though).
        <br>Also on the plans is adding more drawings to the other misc pages like this one and maybe even animate them.
        <br>I think this is a big step on making my site look less... boring i guess.
        <br><b>(22:04)</b> Renamed this page from "paragraphs" to "basement journal", because that's basically what this is.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>15/9/2022 22:05</h2>
        <p>I don't know if i should keep the entrance to here a bit hidden
        <br>or make it more obvious.
        <br>If someone's been upstairs they probably didn't even come down here.
        <br>Which, i don't know if it's a good thing or a bad one.
        <br><b>(22:15)</b> I made the entrance more obvious now.
    </p></div>

    <div class="entry"><h2>13/9/2022 15:43</h2>
        <p>I now realize i'm spending a lot more time here in the basement than upstairs.
        <br>But i guess that's a good thing! I'm being a lot more creative here, where i'm not bound to just one style.
        <br>Here i can make whatever i want and it'll fit, because it's the basement.
        <br>But... I'm kinda sad that upstairs is remaining relatively unchanged.
        <br>I guess when i make some new text in toki pona or blender render or button or something that <b>fits</b> the style of upstairs, i'll put it there.
        <br>Also i think i have to make a button, i know this site already has a bunch of buttons, but none of them <b>works</b> as a button.
