        <p>You wander into the basement downstairs, and see a green door in front of you.
            You can barely make out the words "NO ENTRY" in thick lines, but it's been all
            scribbled over. You enter the room, and there's no one inside. The room smells
            of drywall, and is lit by a monochrome green light somehow. It's nauseating.
            Before you, there is a desk with a thick folder and a notebook. It is beside a
            very scratched and at places dented wall, covered in sticky notes.
        </p>
