        <summary><a>handdrawn/doodle</a></summary>
        When i originally made the handdrawn/doodles page, as the name suggested, everything was supposed to be handdrawn, even the text. But after trying to chroma key the text+drawings out (because i didn't want an ugly border in the images), 
        once with black on white and then with black on green to see if it helped (it didn't, i suck at chroma key), i just gave up and had to settle for the separated text and drawing.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/website/misc/folder/original1.jpg">try #1</a></li>
            <li><a href="/website/misc/folder/original2.jpg">try #2</a></li>
            <li>original <a href="/website/misc/folder/handdrawn">{handdrawn}</a> page</li>
        </ul>
        since everything else was handdrawn (except for the text), the buttons were also supposed to be handdrawn, but the contrast sucked (especially the etc button) so i scrapped it for pixel-y gifs, and changed the header accordingly. 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/website/misc/folder/people_button.jpg">people</a></li>
            <li><a href="/website/misc/folder/ruler_and_compass_button.jpg">ruler and compass</a></li>
            <li><a href="/website/misc/folder/etc_button.jpg">etc (the culprit)</a></li>
        </ul>
