                many people exist
                <br>these people are different
                <br>these people say this:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;these differences aren't important
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;if people are different, they aren't bad
<br>
                <br>but, the world says something else.
                <br>if you're different, other people feel this:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;you are bad.
<br>
                <br>now and for long in the past,
                <br><i>skin color</i> has been a very important difference.
                <br>for many people,
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;white skinned people are good
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;black skinned people are bad
<br>
                <br>because i'm saying this with few words,
                <br>this sounds really bad.
                <br>you can <i>think</i>:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;if people are different, they aren't bad
                <br>but, a lot of the time, you <i>don't know</i> your thoughts
                <br>unconscious thoughts are really important
                <br>these thoughts make up systems
                <br>a lot of your actions follow these systems
                <br>but you don't know them!
<br>
                <br>communities give this doctrine to you
                <br>communities do this when you're really really young
                <br>communities do this all the time
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in schools
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in workplaces
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in your home
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in movies and TV
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in the internet
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>everywhere</i>.
<br>
                <br>but you don't know this!
                <br>because of this, this system (racism) seems good to you
                <br>everyone follows racism!
<br>
                <br>but this system is bad
                <br>because this system is in everyone,
                <br>this system is <i>really</i> bad!
<br>
                <br>this system (racism) can exist in 4 ways:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in internal thoughts
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in communication
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in community structures
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;in community doctrines!
<br>
                <br>i talked about racism in your thoughts
                <br>the best is that you can change and end this!
<br>
                <br>understand this: dark skin people aren't bad!
                <br>they are people like you
                <br>they can feel like you
                <br>they can speak like you
<br>
                <br>one example:
                <br>black people can do bad things
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and can break things
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and can steal things
<br>
                <br>when black people are in a shop,
                <br>people follow them
                <br>and feel this:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;if they steal, i can stop them!
<br>
                <br>but, people that feel this are of a bad system (racism)
                <br>this statement does this to black people:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;they feel bad
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and feel like monsters
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and feel afraid!
                <br>racism makes everyone feel afraid!
<br>
                <br>bad internal thoughts can exist in your actions
                <br>when black people are near, you walk away
                <br>when they look "wrongly" or speak "wrongly" to you, you scold them
<br>
                <br>these bad actions <i>really hurt</i> black people.
                <br>but racism can occur in your words!
                <br>you can speak racist things
<br>
                <br>a lot of people right now are saying racist things
                <br>maybe this is why:
                <br>when they say something racist, they don't feel bad!
                <br>others don't scold them
                <br>they don't want to correct them
<br>
                <br>this is also very bad
                <br>when people stay shut,
                <br>nothing changes
                <br>nothing gets better
<br>
                <br>when you hear racist things...
                <br><i>SPEAK OUT!</i>
                <br>but, when you correct them, their emotions become strong
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and protective!
                <br>they don't want to change
                <br>they say this:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;"i'm not a bad person so i can't be racist"
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;"this country is good, it isn't racist"
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and other things
<br>
                <br>when they feel better, talk to them
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;talk to their feelings
<br>
                <br>i talked about two ways of racism;
                the other 2 are very important
<br>
                <br>i said this:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;words of racism are <i>everywhere</i>!
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and racism can exist in your actions too
<br>
                <br>actually, <i>community structures (institutions)</i> can manifest racism
                <br>...i'm saying:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;your schools,
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and your workplace
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and jails
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and the government/state
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and housing perpetuate racism
<br>
                <br>black people don't have good schools
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;or well-paying jobs
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;so they can't have good homes
<br>
                <br>when they get sick, clinics don't heal them
                <br>in jails, black people are <i>very</i> present
                <br>in government, black people are <i>not</i> present
                <br>when black people are in TV,
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;they are shown as evil
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;when they're in movies,
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;they're the thieves, the villains
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;they are ignorant
<br>
                <br>TV and movies represent black people badly
                <br><i>all</i> institutions don't help black people's lives
<br>
                <br>but... only these structures know this
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;only they know this evil
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;only they know this damage
                <br>white people don't know this
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and <i>don't want</i> to know this
<br>
                <br>white people have good schools
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and well-paying jobs
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and can easily have good homes
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and are well represented in TV
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and are in the government
<br>
                <br>when white people do bad things
                <br>they don't go to jail
                <br>when black people do the same,
                <br>they do go to jail
<br>
                <br>the leaders have killed black people
                <br>for a really long time
                <br>but white people don't know this
<br>
                <br>when people see the death with their phones
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and share them online
                <br>then people do know
                <br>and people complain a lot
                <br>but this complaining ends quickly
                <br>the killing of black people <i>keeps happening</i>
<br>
                <br>this system (racism) is very evil
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and is in everyone
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and is in all communities
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and is in all institutions
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and <i>exists</i>.
<br>
                <br>this evil system (racism) exists in our community
                <br>this evil system (racism) is the <i>soul</i>, a <i>backbone</i> of communities.
                <br>all institutions i mentioned ruin all black people's lives
<br>
                <br>people must <i>end</i> racism
<br>
                <br>but... how do we end it?
                <br>just internet talk isn't good
                <br>you have <i>power</i>
                <br>(if you have light skin, you have a lot of power)
                <br>so, use your power!
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;talk to the leaders of your community
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;give them the knowledge of racism
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>keep</i> talking, <i>keep</i> giving
<br>
                <br>since racism is in <i>a lot of places</i>,
                <br>it's finish will need <i>a lot of time</i> as well
<br>
                <br>also, please know this:
                <br>what i've said isn't everything
                <br>i'm white, so i don't know everything
                <br>so me and you must learn!
                <br>listen to black people because
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;they know their lives
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;and their emotions
<br>
                <br>if people want to change communities,
                <br>they must work <i>hard</i> and <i>keep doing it</i>
            </p>
