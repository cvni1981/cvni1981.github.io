Hi again, i'm doing another redesign yeah...
I need to start trying to make just something that i like how it looks and not overthink too much...
Go light on myself yk? Everyone needs a bit of that.
I'm using the glorious google material design builder (add link here!) that lets me add a color and get all the lightness values i need!
...and use the colors completely incorrectly to the actual design guidelines-

Also i'm not gonna add a musicians page bc i'd rather you just see what music i like instead of me ranking and describing them in a (probably definitely) biased way; or a websites page bc they were all basically stolen from vsauce's dong so... yeah
I also just wanted to have the website have less, this folder already has a lot of stuff...
But i think archiving is a good thing, not just to make sure the past isn't forgotten, but also to see how we change!

Actually this is being written before i added the misc to the index and even rereradded the site link to my status.cafe so there might be another journal entry after this one!

Oh and also i went almost to the time i went to sleep yesterday just coding the website, i'm limiting my time working on this to at most, like, midday. I don't want to worsen my insomnia.
