        <p>You open the door and are greeted by lots of drawers containing cases of movable type, however
            all but one are locked. 
            The smell of wood fills the room. On the wall beside you is an explanatory note.</p>

            <p>hi there! i've been a font connoisseur for a while now, specifically free fonts.
            Though, if you buy a font for. the high prices they command, you're very likely to have
            a higher quality font, more attention to detail and stuff (fontmaking is tedious and 
            sometimes painful work so i kinda get it). But that doesnt take away from the fact that 
            some wonderful souls have made great fonts and made it available for free, for everyone!
            All the fonts on this site are such! And even with. maybe lower quality or weirder fonts,
            you can still make some bangin' designs with them. Except for default fonts, they look boring.<br>
            
            This page is basically all the free fonts i've found so far, as well as the people and 
            foundries who made them and other fontful sites so, if you didn't find a font you like here,
            you'll find them there! Most of the fonts here are under the Open Font License (in super short 
            terms, you can use it freely, modify and redistribute it but sometimes you need to change the name, 
            and be credited for your work. please read the 
            <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/">full license</a> for the actual words.)
            But some fonts are under different licenses, and i'll reference their respective licenses.<br>
            
            Some are unique, some are bland, some are overused, some are clones. Download and use them today!
            or don't im not your mom<br>
        
            Oh and also the pages are <b>full of specimen images</b>, so it might take a while for
            it to load depending on your internet quality</p></details>
