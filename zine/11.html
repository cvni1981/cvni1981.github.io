            <p style="text-align:justify">Plants. They are everywhere. But not many people really think
                much about them or wonder how they work, what they are and why they matter.
                Which is a shame! Plants can be beautiful, astonishing, and indeed, very
                important for basically every living being on this planet.

            <p style="text-align:justify">Your cells need oxygen, brought from the air into your lungs, then blood,
                so it can enter a series of reactions forming ATP, which is used
                to synthesize proteins used by your body to... keep existing.
                And that oxygen will most likely come from plants. <a href="12">But what are they?</a>
