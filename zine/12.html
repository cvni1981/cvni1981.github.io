            <p style="text-align:justify">Seriously, what are plants? What makes a plant a plant?
                Never thought i'd get philosophical about freaking plants, but here we are.
                What is in common with trees, grass, cacti, lily pads, everything
                we commonly call "plants"? They're green I guess? That's not very scientific.
                The one thing that many plants have in common is how they
                produce the oxygen I was talking about earlier.

            <p style="text-align:justify">Plants have a nifty way of converting the carbon in CO2 and water into sugar (or more specifically
                glucose), that they can use in the same reaction our body uses to
                keep ourselves existant. The sugar producing reaction is called
                "photosynthesis", and happens using a pigment called clorophyll, which can be
                often green, but can also be red or brown, as seen in some species of
                algae.<a href="13">Interesting, tell me more...</a>
