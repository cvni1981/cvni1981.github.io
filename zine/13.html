            <p style="text-align:justify">Okay, maybe trying to find ways plants are similar was wrong...
                Maybe we can learn more by looking at ways plants are different!
                Maybe classify them neatly into many, many, <b>many</b> categories...
                Actually, I know what! We'll go through the evolution of plants, as they get
                more and more complex and like the plants we see today! That would be lots of fun!

            <p style="text-align:justify">Maybe, maybe, you can even learn to recognize them out in the wild!
                Ohh i'm so excited! But first, one weird thing about how
                plants reproduce is that it is kinda done in 2 ways at
                the same time. <a href="14">What do you mean by that?</a>
