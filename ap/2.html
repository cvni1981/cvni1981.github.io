            <p style="text-align:justify">Hello! This is a project for a zine that I just... felt like making one day.
                I originally intended it to be a pdf and to be printable into an actual zine,
                but LibreOffice wasn't cutting it and, since I already am acquainted with css 
                and html and because it's very flexible, I decided to make it into a webzine instead,
                hosted on my own website.

        <div style="padding: 0px 100px">
            <p style="text-align:justify">I don't know what to put here. I guess i'll just put things i feel like putting here.
                Stories, some poems, maybe drawings... stuff in general.
                Especially since I have a lot of free time now, and hopefully, with this other place,
                somewhere to put this time to use.
