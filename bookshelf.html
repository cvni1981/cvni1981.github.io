    <div class="main">
        <p>These are books I have read/am reading/want to read.<br>Since i'm working on anti-racism,
        most of them are about race and it's intersections, obviously. These with the 
        <a href="https://raindrop.io/cvni1981/anti-racism-resources-35349568">anti-racism resources</a> collection are
        most of my knowledge sources.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><h2>bell hooks — Writing Beyond Race: Living Theory and Practice</h2><p>
                My first book by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks">
                    bell hooks</a> (as well as the first book
                i've read cover to cover); a collection of essays criticizing art pieces that 
                aimed at being black representation, but failed in one way or another. 
                It also shows the necessity of fighting white supremacy over racism, as well as 
                the importance of love.<br>
            </p></li>
            <li><h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djamila_Ribeiro">
                Djamila Ribeiro</a> — Pequeno Manual Antirracista</h2><p>
                Another smaller collection of studies in portuguese
                aiming to educate the reader into the basics of racism and its many
                areas of influence: representation, interpersonal relations, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_injustice">epistemicide</a>,
                and sadly, many more. It also has a long list of black brazillian writers, which
                i plan on reading!<br>
            </p></li>
                <li><h2>Edson Lopes Cardoso — Nothing Will Bring Them Back: Writings About
                    Racism and Political Battle
                </h2><p>
                Another book in portuguese, this one was written by 
                <a href="http://www.letras.ufmg.br/literafro/autores/230-edson-lopes-cardoso">
                    Edson Lopes Cardoso</a>, an activist of the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_movement_in_Brazil">brazillian
                Black Movement</a> since the 70s; the book is a collection of over a hundred
                texts written since the 80s by various authors about the Black Movement,
                the ongoing genocide against black people (especially the black youth)
                and much more.<br>
