    <h1>misc</h1>
    <p>After going down the stairs and into the basement, you wander into a green door.
        <br>It seems to have the words "staff only" written on it, but it's been scribbled over.
        <br>You step into a dark room, it's completely empty and somehow lit by a monochromatic green light. It's slightly nauseating.
        <br>You see a drawing table. On it is a notebook and a folder. Besides the table is a wall covered in sticky notes.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/mute-ante/i/misc/journal">open the notebook</a></li>
            <li><a href="/mute-ante/i/misc/phrases">look at the sticky notes</a></li>
            <li><a href="/mute-ante/i/misc/folder">open the folder</a></li>
            <li><a href="/mute-ante/i">walk back out the door</a></li>
        </ul>
    </body>
