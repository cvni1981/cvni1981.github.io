            <li><b>handdrawn buttons</b>: since everything else was handdrawn (except for the text), the buttons were also supposed to be handdrawn, but the contrast sucked (especially the etc button) so i scrapped it for pixel-y gifs, and changed the header accordingly.

            <li><a href="/mute-ante/i/misc/archive/handdrawn">{handdrawn}</a>: the original handdrawn/doodles page before there were any drawings, with a little extra message.</li>
            <li>When i originally made the handdrawn/doodles page, as the name suggested, everything was supposed to be handdrawn, even the text. But after trying to chroma key the text+drawings out (because i didn't want an ugly border in the images), 
                once with black on white and then with black on green to see if it helped (it didn't, i suck at chroma key), i just gave up and had to settle for the separated text and drawing.
