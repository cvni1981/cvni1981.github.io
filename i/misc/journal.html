    <h1>basement journal</h1>
    <p>You gingerly open the book, looking out for anyone that calls you out. No one did.
        <br>You read it and realize it's a journal the webmaster keeps for new things that happened in the site.
    </p>
    > <a href="/mute-ante/i/misc">go back</a>
    <h2>19/9/2022 18:02</h2>
    <p>
        Now the miscellaneous page is like a text-only rpg! sort of... Why not?! This whole basement thing is already all over the place.
        <br>Someday i'll put the phrases into actual sticky notes, who knows?!?!
    </p>
    <h2>17/9/2022 12:36</h2>
    <p>
        I renamed the handdrawn page to <a href="/mute-ante/i/doodles">doodles</a>.
        <br><b>(17:00)</b> Idea: make header gif thingies that are slightly different and random everytime someone loads the page.
        <br><b>(17:11)</b> I'M DONE!!!! I've separated all the doodles into categories, this took so longg, all the gifs...<br>
        But i'd say it was worth it.
        <br><b>(17:35)</b> After some nitpicking, i'd say i'm... satisfied with how it turned out. The colors didn't work well with the grid, 
        especially the cyan.
    </p>
    <h2>16/9/2022 20:21</h2>
        <p>After snooping around for some cool websites to put in my <a href="/mute-ante/i/buttons">buttons</a> page and
            looking at other's websites, i think my website is lacking animation.
        <br>Things like gifs, they make the experience more... interesting than just boring, still text.
        <br>I'm working on adding more drawings to <a href="/mute-ante/i/doodles">handdrawn</a> - it'll probably be done by tomorrow - 
        and one of the things i'm adding are animated buttons to different categories (just 3 though).
        <br>Also on the plans is adding more drawings to the other misc pages like this one and maybe even animate them.
        <br>I think this is a big step on making my site look less... boring i guess.
        <br><b>(22:04)</b> Renamed this page from "paragraphs" to "basement journal", because that's basically what this is.
    </p>

    <h2>15/9/2022 22:05</h2>
        <p>I don't know if i should keep the entrance to here a bit hidden
        <br>or make it more obvious.
        <br>If someone's been upstairs they probably didn't even come down here.
        <br>Which, i don't know if it's a good thing or a bad one.
        <br><b>(22:15)</b> I made the entrance more obvious now.
        </p>

    <h2>13/9/2022 15:43</h2>
        <p>I now realize i'm spending a lot more time here in the basement than upstairs.
        <br>But i guess that's a good thing! I'm being a lot more creative here, where i'm not bound to just one style.
        <br>Here i can make whatever i want and it'll fit, because it's the basement.
        <br>But... I'm kinda sad that upstairs is remaining relatively unchanged.
        <br>I guess when i make some new text in toki pona or blender render or button or something that <b>fits</b> the style of upstairs, i'll put it there.
        <br>Also i think i have to make a button, i know this site already has a bunch of buttons, but none of them <b>works</b> as a button.</p>
