    <h2>16/9/2022 20:21</h2>
        <p>After snooping around for some cool websites to put in my <a href="/mute-ante/i/buttons">buttons</a> page and
            looking at other's websites, i think my website is lacking animation.
        <br>Things like gifs, they make the experience more... interesting than just boring, still text.
        <br>I'm working on adding more drawings to <a href="/mute-ante/i/handdrawn">handdrawn</a> - it'll probably be done by tomorrow - 
        and one of the things i'm adding are animated buttons to different categories (just 3 though).
        <br>Also on the plans is adding more drawings to the other misc pages like this one and maybe even animate them.
        <br>I think this is a big step on making my site look less... boring i guess.
    </p>

    <h2>15/9/2022 22:05</h2>
        <p>I don't know if i should keep the entrance to here a bit hidden
        <br>or make it more obvious.
        <br>If someone's been upstairs they probably didn't even come down here.
        <br>Which, i don't know if it's a good thing or a bad one.
        <br><b>(22:15)</b> I made the entrance more obvious now.
        </p>

    <h2>13/9/2022 15:43</h2>
        <p>I now realize i'm spending a lot more time here in the basement than upstairs.
        <br>But i guess that's a good thing! I'm being a lot more creative here, where i'm not bound to just one style.
        <br>Here i can make whatever i want and it'll fit, because it's the basement.
        <br>But... I'm kinda sad that upstairs is remaining relatively unchanged.
        <br>I guess when i make some new text in toki pona or blender render or button or something that <b>fits</b> the style of upstairs, i'll put it there.
        <br>Also i think i have to make a button, i know this site already has a bunch of buttons, but none of them <b>works</b> as a button.</p>
