        <p>I now realize i'm spending a lot more time here in the basement than upstairs.
        <br>But i guess that's a good thing! I'm being a lot more creative here, where i'm not bound to just one style.
        <br>Here i can make whatever i want and it'll fit, because it's the basement.
        <br>But... I'm kinda sad that upstairs is remaining relatively unchanged.
        <br>I guess when i make some new text in toki pona or blender render or button or something that *fits* the style of upstairs, i'll put it there.
        <br>Also i think i have to make a button, i know this site already has a bunch of buttons, but none of them *work* as a button.</p>
