            <br>But i got the meat she wanted for lunch, i think... 
            <br>hmm... no i can't remember what she asked for.
            <br>
            <br>And i don't really want to ask her just for the completeness of this..
            <br>Anything else?
            <br>No.. i don't think...
            <br>Not much has been happening lately, i've just been chatting with my friends on my phone...
