    <p>Hi! Welcome to my slice of the web where i put stuff i like, stuff i do and other things too!<br>
    Making this website has been really fun, and i hope you like having a gander at it.<br>
    (put this stuff in an about page i guess)
    I speak Portuguese (native), English (near-native) and toki pona (proficient).<br>
    Also, i've liked coding for a while now; mainly in python and pygame mostly because they're easy, but now also html and css i guess!<br>
    Favorite passtimes include: (ul)chatting in discord, listening to music, working on this website, doodling things and seeing new places!(/ul)<br>
    Regarding gender and things, i'm... kinda confused. Non-binary i guess. Use they/them just to be sure.<br>
    (/put this stuff in an about page i guess)<br>
    This thing has been pretty much always in construction since i've started it, so things may appear and disappear from time to time. It's normal around here i guess.<br>
    Make yourself at home!</p>
