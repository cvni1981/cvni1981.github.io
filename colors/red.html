        <h1>red</h1>
        <p style="padding: 10px">
            Ooh, red. It's a very violent looking color, often related to things like blood 
            and fire. So it has a close connection to war and conflict. Mars is called the
            red planet because it's covered in iron oxide - basically really rusty iron - 
            which looks red at interplanetary distances! In fact, it's called Mars because
            it's the name of the roman god of war. Probably because it's red like blood.
            <br>
            <br>Actually blood is red for the same reason Mars is red, because the iron in
            hemoglobin reflects red light! And that also gives meat a red or pink (basically
            light red) color because there's hemoglobin there.
            <br>
            <br>Speaking of iron, the very first colors to be used in cave paintings were black, 
            white and red; the latter was acquired from ochre, which is basically clay with
            iron oxide.
            <br>
            <br>Over time, people have found many many more red pigments, like Kermes from the
            neolithic period, made up by crushing insects of the Kermes genus, and it was
            used in luxury clothes all over 14th century Europe.
            <br>
            <br>Another notable red pigment is the one from the <i>Paubrasilia</i> tree, once found all 
            over the coast of South America, and the Portuguese colonists gave it the name 
            <i>Pau-Brasil</i> (<i>pau</i> meaning wood and <i>brasil</i> meaning amber-like, kinda like "blazing"
            ). And it quickly grew popular (and rare!) as it was in high demand during the 
            Renaissance. 
            <br>
            In fact, the name <i>Pau-Brasil</i> gave the country they found it in its name!
            But they over-harvested the tree and didn't really replant it; nowadays it's a
            very endangered species.
            <br>
            <br>Back to associations with things, red is the color that attracts the most 
            attention! It's a very eye-catching color, so you see it everywhere in logos and
            advertisements.
            It's also why lifeguards and fire-fighters use red, to be easily found within a crowd.
            <br>
            <br>Red is also commonly associated with sin and seduction, because it's also
            connected to danger and passion. Satan is almost always represented by red.
            And since the 20th century, only certain neighborhoods were allowed to have
            places made for prostitution; today they are called "red-light districts", with
            high concentration of sex shops and the like. The largest ones today are in
            Amsterdam and Bangkok.
            Also, the symbol for sex workers' rights is a red umbrella.
            <br>
            <br>Also, red is found in 77% of flags around the world, by far the most
            commonly used one; it's in the flag of the USA, the UK, France, Germany,
            the UK, Mexico and many others.
            Together with blue and white, they make the Pan-Slavic colors, with white and
            green are the Pan-Arabic colors and with yellow, green and black, are the 
            Pan-African colors!
            <br>
            <br>As recently as the 19th century, with the Industrial Revolution and workers
            wanting better working environments, red became the key color of Socialism, and
            with the Russian Revolution succeeding in 1917, it became standard of communist
            countries all over the world.
            <br>
            <br>But let's not get too much into politics and wrap it up, this is getting a bit
            long.
            So, yeah! That's the history of red, how it's used around the world and many
            other things.
            I think red is a very nice color. I associate it with danger, love, action; it
            feels like it wants to move even when it's still.
