    <h1>introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Alright, so.
        <br>
        <br>Before i can start teaching the actual language i have to talk a bit about it.
        <br>Unlike a bunch of other languages like English or French or Japanese, which appeared naturally in a community, toki pona is a "constructed language", made by just one person. In this case it's Sonja Lang, a canadian linguist!
        <br>
        <br>And toki pona is very notable because it has just 137 words.
        <br>And you can use them to talk about basically everything in the universe.
        <br>But how?????
        <br>
        <br>The answer is pretty simple: to let a word mean many things at once that, in another language, may be represented by different words.
        <br>For example, let's look at the first word in the name of the language:
        <br>
        <br><i>toki.</i>
        <br>
        <br>It can mean many things: speech, communication, talking...
        <br>But it can also mean language or be used as a greeting:
        <br>
        <br><i>toki!</i> ≃ hello!
        <br>
        <br>You might have also noticed that one word can be of different functions; that is, it can work as a noun (language), verb (talking) or an adjective (verbal/something that has to do with language/speaking)!
        <br>
        <br><i>mi sona e <u>toki</u> pona</i> ≃ i know <u>toki</u> pona <b>(noun)</b>
        <br>
        <br><i>mi <u>toki</u> suli</i> ≃ i <u>speak</u> loudly <b>(verb)</b>
        <br>
        <br><i>mi jo e ilo <u>toki</u></i> ≃ i have a <u>speech</u> tool/phone <b>(adjective)</b>
        <br>
        <br>Now, you may be thinking:
        <br>"how am i gonna know what a word means if it has so many meanings??"
        <br>
        <br>The answer, as with many things, is <b>context</b>.
        <br>
        <br>Let's see another example:
