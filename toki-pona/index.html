    <h1>introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Alright, so.
        <br>
        <br>Before i can start teaching the actual language i have to talk a bit about it.
        <br>Unlike a bunch of other languages like English or French or Japanese, which appeared naturally in a community, toki pona is a "constructed language", made by just one person. In this case it's Sonja Lang, a canadian linguist!
        <br>
        <br>And toki pona is very notable because it has just 137 words.
        <br>And you can use them to talk about basically everything in the universe.
        <br>But how?????
        <br>
        <br>The answer is pretty simple: to let a word mean many things at once that, in another language, may be represented by different words.
        <br>For example, let's look at the first word in the name of the language:
        <br>
        <br>    <i>toki.</i>
        <br>
        <br>It can mean many things: speech, communication, talking...
        <br>But it can also mean language or be used as a greeting:
        <br>
        <br>    <i>toki!</i> â‰ƒ hello!
    </p>
