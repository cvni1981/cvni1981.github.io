        <h1>icossymetry</h1>
        <a href="/website/blender">go back</a>
        <p>This whole thing started when i wanted to recreate the floor pattern in this iconic maths video, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aN6vX7qXPQ">Not Knot</a> by the Geometry Center.
            I knew i couldn't really recreate it bc it was a hyperbolic tiling, but i still tried to do
            something similar.<br><br>
            The idea was to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedral_symmetry">the icosahedron's symmetry group</a> 
            out of circle beziers, give them thickness then 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection">project</a> 
            their shadow onto a plane below it all.</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry1.jpg">
            <p class="sub">1.</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry2.jpg">
            <p class="sub">2. just the projection without the icossymetry thing</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry3.jpg">
            <p class="sub">3. the shadow when the ball is rotated in an arbitrary direction;
                also, all the curves are circles! That's because of the stereographic projection.</p>
            
            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry4.jpg">
            <p class="sub">4. here, i've put a metal sphere right under the icossymetry ball...<br>
            i'm calling it the symmetry group. And i noticed the shadow reflected in the metal ball
            as neat curvy lines, so i wanted to get a closer look:</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry5.jpg">
            <p class="sub">5. oh yeah. That looks nice. And you can see the metal ball's shadow on it's own reflection!</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry6.jpg">
            <p class="sub">6. a closeup shot showing some of the shadow in the back.<br>I wanted to use this as a
            wallpaper, but my icons were on the left side, so i wanted to take another shot instead of, yk. just flipping the image.</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry7.jpg">
            <p class="sub">7. hmm a little bit more of the back...</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry8.jpg">
            <p class="sub">8. there we go.</p>

            <p>If you make the icosahedral ball thing with straight lines instead of circles, you get a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disdyakis_triacontahedron">disdyakis triacontahedron</a>...
                Thankfully blender has a mesh extra objects addon with a bunch of polyhedra including this one!</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry9.jpg">
            <p class="sub">9. the didsdyakis thing with a wireframe modifier and an emission material that makes it glow,
                another one that's transparent so you can still see the back kinda, but it's darker.
                Also with a smooth sphere in the bottom lit up by the polyhedron. Also also probably the start of my love
                for noisy renders.....</p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry10.jpg">
            <p class="sub">10. basically the same thing but the bottom sphere is bigger and the polyhedron
            clips through it! Also i think the bottom sphere has a glossy material with a bit of roughness.
            </p>  

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry11.jpg">
            <p class="sub">11. also the same thing but without the wireframe and this time lit by 2
                sun lights in opposite angles.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry12.jpg">
            <p class="sub">12. same thing as 11 but <i>with</i> a wireframe modifier.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry13.jpg">
            <p class="sub">13. now seen from above! Nice symmetry.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry14.jpg">
            <p class="sub">14. now the camera is inside the ball just below the pillars; exactly where the
                light was in the earlier shadow renders! Also with a <b><i>really</i></b> wide angle.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry15.jpg">
            <p class="sub">15. The shadow of the thick wireframe thing.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry16.jpg">
            <p class="sub">16. 14 again but the bottom ball is <i>almost</i> no roughness. i think 0.1. I remember
                trying to look at where the spokes intersect the mirrorball, but they aren't here for some reason.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry17.jpg">
            <p class="sub">17. Just the wireframe disdyakis thing with an orthographic projection camera. It kinda
                looks like a dodecahedron if you squint hard enough.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry18.jpg">
            <p class="sub">18. a closeup of 10 spokes coming together!
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry19.jpg">
            <p class="sub">19. it's number 9 but this time the disdyakis doesn't glow... I honestly dont know how i made this one
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry20.jpg">
            <p class="sub">20. The wireframe and unwireframed disdyakises together.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry21.jpg">
            <p class="sub">21. 20 but the bit of the wireframe sticking out of the solid one is thinner. Also
                it's more focused on the darker band that's in the shadow of both sun lights.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry22.jpg">
            <p class="sub">22. This time the wireframe is rotated!
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry23.jpg">
            <p class="sub">23. Here, i've put 2 planes crossing the wireframe vertically, but since the camera is
                orthographic and looking from above, we don't see the planes, just the shadow!
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry24.jpg">
            <p class="sub">24. Back to the shadowy reflection renders.
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry25.jpg">
            <p class="sub">25. Here's where i start to experiment more with reflections and refractions and stuff.
                This is a half cylinder with a glass material, so it's basicaly a lens. But the shading isn't smooth
                so you can see the staggered refractions! Also the symmetry ball, oops
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry26.jpg">
            <p class="sub">26. This time i wanted to see the symmetry ball sliced up by the flat faces!
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry27.jpg">
            <p class="sub">27. The same as 25 but looking downwards, i think
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry28.jpg">
            <p class="sub">28. now looking right; you can see refractions of refractions?
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry29.jpg">
            <p class="sub">29. 28 but now properly rounded!
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry30.jpg">
            <p class="sub">30. I think this is just looking directly at the symmetry ball with the light at the center
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry31.jpg">
            <p class="sub">31. Now i've covered the symmetry ball under a glass ball! Looks super cool and... liquidy
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry32.jpg">
            <p class="sub">32. this is what the camera saw when it was just at 0, 0, 0, and i thought it looked kinda cool
                so i just rendered it
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry33.jpg">
            <p class="sub">33. i'm pretty sure this is looking through a glass (half?) cyllinder
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry34.jpg">
            <p class="sub">34. i think the sphere now has a mixed glass and glossy material so you can see refractions AND 
                reflections on it!
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry35.jpg">
            <p class="sub">35. OK so- it's a concave half cylinder mirror looking at the symmetry ball thing, idk how to
                explain it properly
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry36.jpg">
            <p class="sub">36. The same thing but focusing on another place, looks super liquidy again- all just from
                curved mirror reflections!
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry37.jpg">
            <p class="sub">37. Now looking at the shadow again, but through a REVERSE cyllinder lens, cool and curvy (but a bit
                pointy in a few places)
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry38.jpg">
            <p class="sub">38. the reverse cyllinder lens itself, i was showing some renders to a friend so i just rendered
                the lens by itself to show them how i was making stuff
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry39.jpg">
            <p class="sub">39. now looking through another angle
            </p>

            <img src="icossymetry/icosymmetry40.jpg">
            <p class="sub">40. i think this is also the reverse cyllinder lens, but you can see the pointy edges so it doesn't look
                TOO good...
