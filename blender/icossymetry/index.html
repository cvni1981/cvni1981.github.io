        <p>This whole thing started when i wanted to recreate the floor pattern in this iconic maths video, 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aN6vX7qXPQ">Not Knot</a> by the Geometry Center.
        I knew i couldn't really recreate it bc it was a hyperbolic tiling, but i still tried to do
        something similar.<br><br>
        The idea was to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedral_symmetry">the icosahedron's symmetry group</a> 
        out of circle beziers, give them thickness then 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection">project</a> 
        their cool shadow onto a plane below it all.</p>
        <br>

        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry2.jpg">
        <p><b>2.</b> just the projection without the icossymetry thing</p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry3.jpg">
        <p><b>3.</b> the shadow when the ball is rotated in an arbitrary direction;
            also, all the curves are circles! That's because of the stereographic projection.</p></div>
            <br>
        
        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry4.jpg">
        <p><b>4.</b> here, i've put a metal sphere right under the icossymetry ball...<br>
        i'm calling it the symmetry group. And i noticed the shadow reflected in the metal ball
        as neat curvy lines, so i wanted to get a closer look:</p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry5.jpg">
        <p><b>5.</b> oh yeah. That looks nice. And you can see the metal ball's shadow on it's own reflection!</p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry6.jpg">
        <p><b>6.</b> a closeup shot showing some of the shadow in the back.<br>I wanted to use this as a
        wallpaper, but my icons were on the left side, so i wanted to take another shot instead of, yk. just flipping the image.</p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry7.jpg">
        <p><b>7.</b> hmm a little bit more of the back...</p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry8.jpg">
        <p><b>8.</b> there we go.</p></div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>If you make the icosahedral ball thing with straight lines instead of circles, you get a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disdyakis_triacontahedron">disdyakis triacontahedron</a>...
            Thankfully blender has a mesh extra objects addon with a bunch of polyhedra including this one!</p>
            <br><br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry9.jpg">
        <p><b>9.</b> the didsdyakis thing with a wireframe modifier and an emission material that makes it glow,
            another one that's transparent so you can still see the back kinda, but it's darker.
            Also with a smooth sphere in the bottom lit up by the polyhedron. Also also probably the start of my love
            for noisy renders.....</p></div>
            <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry10.jpg">
        <p><b>10.</b> basically the same thing but the bottom sphere is bigger and the polyhedron
        clips through it! Also i think the bottom sphere has a glossy material with a bit of roughness.
        </p></div>
        <br>  

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry11.jpg">
        <p><b>11.</b> also the same thing but without the wireframe and this time lit by 2
            sun lights in opposite angles.
        </p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry12.jpg">
        <p><b>12.</b> same thing as 11 but <i>with</i> a wireframe modifier.

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry13.jpg">
        <p><b>13.</b> now seen from above! Nice symmetry.

        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry14.jpg">
        <p><b>14.</b> now the camera is inside the ball just below the pillars; exactly where the
            light was in the earlier shadow renders! Also with a <b><i>really</i></b> wide angle.

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry16.jpg">
        <p><b>16.</b> 14 again but the bottom ball is <i>almost</i> no roughness. i think 0.1. I remember
            trying to look at where the spokes intersect the mirrorball, but they aren't here for some reason.
        </p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry17.jpg">
        <p><b>17.</b> Just the wireframe disdyakis thing with an orthographic projection camera. It kinda
            looks like a dodecahedron if you squint hard enough.
        </p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry18.jpg">

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry19.jpg">
        <p><b>19.</b> it's number 9 but this time the disdyakis doesn't glow... I honestly dont know how i made this one

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry21.jpg">
        <p><b>21.</b> 20 but the bit of the wireframe sticking out of the solid one is thinner. Also
            it's more focused on the darker band that's in the shadow of both sun lights.
        </p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry22.jpg">

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry23.jpg">
        <p><b>23.</b> Here, i've put 2 planes crossing the wireframe vertically, but since the camera is
            orthographic and looking from above, we don't see the planes, just the shadow!

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry24.jpg">
        <p><b>24.</b> Back to the shadowy reflection renders.

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry25.jpg">
        <p><b>25.</b> Here's where i start to experiment more with reflections and refractions and stuff.
            This is a half cylinder with a glass material, so it's basicaly a lens. But the shading isn't smooth
            so you can see the staggered refractions! Also the symmetry ball, oops
        </p></div>
        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry26.jpg">
        <p><b>26.</b> This time i wanted to see the symmetry ball sliced up by the flat faces!

        <p><b>27.</b> The same as 25 but looking downwards, i think

        <p><b>28.</b> now looking right; you can see refractions of refractions?

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry30.jpg">
        <p><b>30.</b> I think this is just looking directly at the symmetry ball with the light at the center

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry31.jpg">
        <p><b>31.</b> Now i've covered the symmetry ball under a glass ball! Looks super cool and... liquidy

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry32.jpg">
        <p><b>32.</b> this is what the camera saw when it was just at 0, 0, 0, and i thought it looked kinda cool
            so i just rendered it

        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry33.jpg">
        <p><b>33.</b> i'm pretty sure this is looking through a glass (half?) cyllinder

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry34.jpg">
        <p><b>34.</b> i think the sphere now has a mixed glass and glossy material so you can see refractions AND 
            reflections on it!

        <br>

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry35.jpg">
        <p><b>35.</b> OK so- it's a concave half cylinder mirror looking at the symmetry ball thing, idk how to
            explain it properly

        <div class="image"><img src="icosymmetry36.jpg">

        <p><b>40.</b> i think this is also the reverse cyllinder lens, but you can see the pointy edges so it doesn't look
