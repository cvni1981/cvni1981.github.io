            <p>A bunch of things exploring glass and refraction; with 8 name series things, sorted by. interestingness.</p>
        <h2>parallax</h2>
        <p>This is called parallax for. worldbuilding reasons. These are all built off an X looking shape that intersects 
            into losenges and i love how these turned out, especially after burnout.
        </p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="parallax1.png"><p>
            <b>1.</b> Kinda basic and. doesnt even have much refraction but i put this and the next one here for completeness' sake.
            With a plane cutting up the color lights that have a super pleasing color scheme, kinda like the tritanopia colors. Feels sweet</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="parallax2.png"><p>
            <b>2.</b> Same thing but seen from the side. Looks weirdly like a physical metal thing, i like it!</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="parallax3.png"><p>
            <b>3.</b> The first one with actual refraction and with a different color scheme. You can barely differentiate the shapes, it's just semi-repeating patters, it's cool!</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="parallax4.png"><p>
            <b>4.</b> I'm actually using this one as my wallpaper as i type this. A bit different coloscheme from the first 2, but now with
            what i realized are basically the panafrican colors. Also i discovered depth of field in blender so some places are nicely out of focus! nice</p></div><br> 

        <h2 id="glass_cube">glass cube</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite series i've done!</p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube1.png">
            <p><b>1.</b> 3 nested glass cubes... if you can tell. This and 2 and 3 are too noisy.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube2.png">
            <p><b>2.</b> Same thing, but we're looking straight on the outer cube's face, so it's a square!.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube3.png">
            <p><b>3.</b> Again, but seen from the side now, and there might be a plane making the reflection.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube5.png">
            <p><b>5.</b> This and the next ones all have a bunch of bars behind it! And they have smooth shading, hence the gradient. Also the number 4 was this but denoised.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube6.png">
            <p><b>6.</b> 5 but with another cube inside. You can even see the reflection on the bottom side!</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube7.png">
            <p><b>7.</b> Same thing but a vertex faces the camera, so it looks like a hexagon! Some neat refractions.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube8.png">
            <p><b>8.</b> One of my favorites (of the favorites), with the bars all tilted and meeting each other in neat places, especially near the bottom.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube9.png">
            <p><b>9.</b> Similar to the first, but rotated and 16:9.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube10.png">
            <p><b>10.</b> Here i tried somehting a bit different with a light background that i'd. probably never use. This one refracts some bars inside the cube.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube11.png">
            <p><b>11.</b> Zoom into the center with a bit of rotation to make it more interesting.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube12.png">
            <p><b>12.</b> Just a tube and a cube, all inside a glass cube that gives them a bit of a bend and a nice blurry thing. A bit too much noise though</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube13.png">
            <p><b>13.</b> This is 2 intersecting glass cubes meeting at a vertex with one's face facing the camera, making a cool square hexagon shape thing.</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="glasscube14.png">
            <p><b>14.</b> The same 2 cubes but rotated a bit and with a plane splitting the cubes and making a neat shadow.</p></div>
            <br>
        <p>These arent <i>technically</i> glass cubes, but they also have the bars behind them, so they're here too.</p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic12.png">
            <p><b>basic12.</b> Now it's a sphere, and the bars go inside it this time!</div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic13.png">
            <p><b>basic13.</b> Now a tilted cyllinder, and refracting the bars in neat wave patterns!</p></div>
            <br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic14.png">
            <p><b>basic14.</b> A bunch of nested cyllinders. A bit too much reflection</p></div>
            <br>
        <h2 id="glass_cube">globo signoff</h2>
        <p>These are based off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g5khE00f3Y">an old signoff id</a> used by the brasilian tv channel in 1979. Made with actual physical
            glass cubes and towers moved around. It's kinda cool and. creepy. Number 1 was too boring, idk what happened to number 3.
        </p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="globosignoff2.png"><p>
            <b>2.</b> Pretty simple, just a cube with a sphere inside it, with the glass faces splitting up and stretching the sphere inside.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="globosignoff4.png"><p>
            <b>4.</b> The glass towers that appeared in the ident, actually exactly recreated from the ident. Bc they're lit up on the bottom with a slanted top, the top lights up too like the ident! cool</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="globosignoff5.png"><p>
            <b>5.</b> The same buildings now seen from above and with a slight grue color and a yellow sphere on the right, i don't really like this one</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="globosignoff6.png"><p>
            <b>6.</b> The same as number 5 but without the sphere! better</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="globosignoff7.png"><p>
            <b>7.</b> The same buildings now seen from alomst 90 degrees from the side with lots of cool refractions and reflections.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="globosignoff8.png"><p>
            <b>8.</b> Back to the glass cube with a sphere, with a bunch of them filling up the screen. Maybe with less noise i'd actually use this as a wallpaper.</p></div><br>
        <h2 id="glass_cube">prisms</h2>
        <p>These i tried during the burnout after the parallax ones. These are all made of the same glass building block sort of.
        </p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="prisms1.png"><p>
            <b>1.</b> 2 neat shapes where some glass surfaces are self intersecting so blender freaks out and makes them black and neat.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="prisms2.png"><p>
            <b>2.</b> The more interesting shape now seen from the side and with a mirror sphere on the side to make it more interesting. Kinda looks like a modernist building.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="prisms3.png"><p>
            <b>3.</b> Same thing now with a tilted mirror reflecting the prisms and the sphere.</p></div><br>
        <h2 id="glass_cube">nonagon</h2>
        <p>I like the nonagon, it's odd and interesting. This is using a kind of glass nonagonal prism but twisted so all the
            faces intersect neatly in the middle! Some of my favorites
        </p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="nonagon1.png"><p>
            <b>1.</b> This first one just shows the middle with the intersecting sides and the light shining from the side. Super neat!</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="nonagon2.png"><p>
            <b>2.</b> I think this is looking into the prism's inside with a light shining through the back with a glass sphere making the circle in the middle. weird</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="nonagon3.png"><p>
            <b>3.</b> The light's now shining from the bottom! Super cool</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="nonagon4.png"><p>
            <b>4.</b> Looking from above again, you can really see the nine sides here. Nice and pointy</p></div><br>
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="dodecahedron">dodecahedron</h2>
        <p>One of if not my favorite polyhedron.</p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="dodecahedron.png"> <p>
            <b>1.</b> Just a dodecahedron with a point light inside it.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="dodecahedron2.png"><p>
            <b>2.</b> Different angle, sun light.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="dodecahedron3.png"><p>
            <b>3.</b> Now with a 16:9 ratio and another neater angle with 3 pentagons!.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="dodecahedron4.png"><p>
            <b>4.</b> The dodecahedron now very close to another sphere; looks like an asteroid about to impact.</p></div><br>
        <h2 id="basic">basic</h2>
        <p>The first 6 images in the basics were. too basic.</p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic7.png"> 
            <p><b>7.</b> Good ol' rough sphere. It sits on a plane that you can see on the reflection; but you cant see the plane bc orthographic projection.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic8.png"> 
            <p><b>8.</b> Similar to the previous, but with an icosphere, and a sun light shining through it</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic9.png"> 
            <p><b>9.</b> Now the sun is shining from the bottom, and we see it shine through the top! Also, this and the previous image were basically remade but in gif form in the <a href="/website/blender/buttons">button renders</a> page!</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic10.png">
            <p><b>10.</b> Same as 9 but the light shines onto a sphere over it. So pretty!</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="basic11.png">
            <p><b>11.</b> Same again, but now we look straight on the sun light.</p></div><br>
        <h2 id="glass_cube">icosahedron</h2>
        <p>Basically the same as dodecahedron but with another super neat polyhedron.
        </p><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron1.png"><p>
            <b>1.</b> A tilted icosahedron with a bit of noise.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron2.png"><p>
            <b>2.</b> The same thing with more noise! a bit too much though</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron3.png"><p>
            <b>3.</b> The icosahedron's now buried and casting a cool shadow.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron4.png"><p>
            <b>4.</b> Now the camera's inside the glass icosahedron! Makes some cool gradients</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron5.png"><p>
            <b>5.</b> The same as the first 2 but now on a black background i'd actually use!</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron6.png"><p>
            <b>6.</b> The same as the earlier but now denoised. Idk it's fine</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron7.png"><p>
            <b>7.</b> Noisy again and now facing the camera so it's all cool and symmetrical.</p></div><br>
        <div class="image"><img src="icosahedron8.png"><p>
            <b>8.</b> Again with a light background but with more contrast refracted by the glass!</p></div><br>
