        <p>Hi! These are (most) of the things i've done in blender over the last while.<br>
        The original files are 1920x1080 (bigger even than my own display lol), so they're
        800x450 to save your precious bandwidth at least a little bit.<br>
        Also these images (and this site) are licensed under <a href="LICENSE.txt">GPLv3</a>.<br>
        Most of these series weren't made in one sitting, mostly over months of suddenly wanting
        to do that one thing again.<br>
        You can see how many images each page has next to the link, so if your internet isn't too good,
        maybe these won't be the fastest loading times...</p>
