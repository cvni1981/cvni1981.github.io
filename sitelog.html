        <br>and that's it! enjoy the sitelog ig</p></details>

        <h2>24/2/2023 18:43</h2>
        <p>I've added <a href="words/nothing">a blog thing</a>! It only has one entry, but (hopefully) i'll write more for it in the future.</p> 
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>6/2/2023 14:45</h2>
        <p>The redesign is finally done!!!</p> 
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>4/2/2023 14:21</h2>
        <p>I'm redesigning the site, this time with mobile <b>in mind</b> (wow!) and in <b>light mode</b>! It's gonna be ready sometime in the future!</p> 
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>4/1/2023 11:43</h2>
        <p>I finally made a <a href="words/diary">new words thing</a>!</p> 
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>30/12/2022 12:32</h2>
        <p>I moved the status.cafe thing to the index, where it always should have been.</p> 
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>14/12/2022 20:14</h2>
        <p>I've added a new section called <a href="words/blips.html">blips</a>, for some shorter things I've written!</p> 
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>17/11/2022 21:31</h2>
        <p>Changed the doodles to get bigger when you hover over them!</p> 
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>9/11/2022 22:13</h2>
        <p>Added a section to the about me page with some quick info... about me</p>   
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>25/10/2022 15:58</h2>
        <p>Changed the intro page to be more simplistic and removed the sidebar.</p>    
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>8/10/2022 08:09</h2>
        <p>Changed the website style to a blue/yellowish theme! Much better than the boring blacks and greys. Also i added an arrow to the sidebar so it's easier to tell what page you're in!</p>    
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>7/10/2022 23:15</h2>
        <p>Made the doodle things smaller in resolution so they (hopefully) load faster!</p>    
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>6/10/2022 21:40</h2>
        <p>I changed the css of my status.cafe to its own thing! It was supposed to look like a typewriter... kinda. This isn't really a <b>site</b> update, but this is the best place i could put this.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>6/10/2022 16:50</h2>
        <p>Greatly embiggened the <a href="musicians">musicians</a> page, now with bigger and better (hopefully) descriptions! Also i kinda wanna remake this site a bit!</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>1/10/2022 16:13</h2>
        <p>New <a href="doodles">doodles</a>! Also, happy october! Also I changed the theme for this log to amber and it looks AWESOME!!!!</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>28/9/2022 21:36</h2>
        <p>I changed nimi mute to <a href="words">words</a> now that there are a couple english things there!</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>26/9/2022 17:50</h2>
        <p>I wanted to change the layout a tad, and now it's finally done! Yayyyy</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>20/9/2022 20:14</h2>
        <p>I have a <a href="https://cvni81.123guestbook.com/">guestbook</a> now! If you've got any feedback to give or any questions, you can say them there.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>17/9/2022 17:10</h2>
        <p>More drawings added to <a href="doodles">doodles</a>, also now put into categories instead of on a list.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>13/9/2022 16:49</h2>
        <p>Added some drawings to <a href="doodles">doodles</a> and added a new <a href="misc">miscellaneous</a> page for things that have no other place that i can put them.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>12/9/2022 16:56</h2>
        <p>I've added <a href="doodles">another new page</a> for me to put drawings, which i make a bunch of. However, it doesn't have much there currently. Hopefully it will in the future.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>12/9/2022 09:20</h2>
        <p>There is now <a href="buttons">a new page</a> dedicated to showcasing buttons other people made that lead to their websites, as well as embedding the curly brackets within the css, so i don't have to add in needlessly long spans.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>11/9/2022 18:15</h2>
        <p>Some "new" blender <a href="blender/cmyk">cmyk</a> things! (Actually i added them a bit ago but removed them)</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>11/9/2022 18:46</h2>
        <p>Created the {basement} section of the website and added, for the very first time, a johnvertisement. Now that i have a section of the website that is solely dedicated to hot having a theme (or having a theme that matches rather well with other themes), things like this are fit for it.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>11/9/2022 18:15</h2>
        <p>Just added a new section called <a href="i">{i}</a>. Whenever i feel like making something that doesn't fit the vibe of the rest of the website, i'll put it there, whatever it may be. Also, it has it's own changelog, so anything that changes there will be there, not here. Again, whole different vibe.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>10/9/2022 18:55</h2>
        <p>I made a couple <a href="blender/buttons">buttons</a>. <img src="blender/buttons/walking.gif" alt="walking"></p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>8/9/2022 19:36</h2>
        <p>I moved the navigation thingy to the top of the page so it doesn't mess up much with the centering!</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>7/9/2022 09:33</h2>
        <p>I changed the font in the <a href="words">words</a> section to Atkinson Hyperlegible, because the previous font's legibility sucked. I can even read it without glasses. <i>The power of design.</i></p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>3/9/2022 17:13</h2>
        <p>I now have a <a href="https://status.cafe/users/cvni81" class="cafe">status.cafe</a> thing after it decided not to give me the confirmation email darnit. I tried to put it at the start but it didn't seem to work and here seemed more appropriate.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>1/9/2022 19:45</h2>
        <p>I might have added a bit too much but it's done now!</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>1/9/2022 15:48</h2>
        <p>I just added a little box to help navigating through the site easier. Just a couple more things and i'll be done...</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>31/8/2022 22:06</h2>
        <p>Alright, i'm done remaking the site! Not fully, there's still some things i want to do, but it's already better, i think.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>31/8/2022 20:26</h2>
        <p>It's been a while since i've reinstalled Ubuntu, but i'm back and made another <a href="words/sona-pini">little poem</a>! Also i feel like changing the layout again...</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>18/8/2022 06:29</h2>
        <p>I added a <a href="words/ona">new toki pona poem thing</a>.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>14/8/2022 13:59</h2>
        <p>Ok so, i made all links bold from the css files, but that meant having to remove almost ALL the bold tags from all the pages... That took 50 minutes?? jeez...</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>14/8/2022 13:09</h2>
        <p>I added <a href="blender/pyramids" class="pyramid">some more blender things</a> with purple/blue and yellow pyramids.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>12/8/2022 19:12</h2>
        <p>Changed the index layout some. I think it's better.</p>
    </div><div id="entry">
        <h2>12/8/2022 17:42</h2>
        <p>I just added the <a href="blender">blender images</a> and now <a href="sitelog">this log</a> so i can keep better track of what i've added to the site. Also i feel like restructuring the site, the list format isn't working, i think.</p>
