            i made this site with Firefox in Ubuntu, with a crappy 1366x768 display<br>
            did my best to make it look decent on mobile, if there's something wrong, please tell me! (<a href="http://discordapp.com/users/691348576093077535" class="discord">discord</a>)<br>
            in existence since july 2022<br>
            been through 7 (? idk anymore) redesigns<br>
            the general theme/objective for this is to try to do as much as possible with as little as possible, while still being kinda interesting.<br>
            And old web aesthetic (?) with cool fonts. Idk if i succeeded h</details>

Now that i have a section of the website that is solely dedicated to hot having a theme (or having a theme that matches rather well with other themes), things like this are fit for it.</p>

Whenever i feel like making something that doesn't fit the vibe of the rest of the website, i'll put it there, whatever it may be. Also, it has it's own changelog, so anything that changes there will be there, not here. Again, whole different vibe.</p>
