            <p>Created the {basement} section of the website and added, for the very first time, a johnvertisement. Now that i have a section of the website that is solely dedicated to hot having a theme (or having a theme that matches rather well with other themes), things like this are fit for it.</p>
        </div><div class="entry">
            <h3>11/9/2022 18:15</h3>
            <p>Just added a new section called <a href="i">{i}</a>. Whenever i feel like making something that doesn't fit the vibe of the rest of the website, i'll put it there, whatever it may be. Also, it has it's own changelog, so anything that changes there will be there, not here. Again, whole different vibe.</p>

            <h3>7/9/2022 09:33</h3>
            <p>I changed the font in the <a href="words">words</a> section to Atkinson Hyperlegible, because the previous font's legibility sucked. I can even read it without glasses. <i>The power of design.</i></p>
        </div><div class="entry">
            <h3>3/9/2022 17:13</h3>

            <h3>12/8/2022 17:42</h3>
