        <p style="max-width: 40rem">These are just the usual fonts we use for stuff. With the earliest ones appearing
            in the late 1800s, then used a ton in posters and ads and books and stuff. Evolving through grotesques,
            neo-grotesques, geometric and humanist fonts that we see everywhere now.

                <p>DIN is short for "Deutsches Institut für Normung", basically the German Standards Institute. They,
                    like the International Standards Association (ISO), set standards for whatever needs standards. Screw
                    sizes, paper sizes, train cars and traffic signs.

                        <p>Before DIN (before Germany even), the Prussian Rail Administration (KPEV) designed a
                            typeface to identify locomotives and platforms and other train stuffs, made to be drawn
                            with just ruler and compass, simple but effective. This one and almost all the others on this
                            section are made by Peter Wiegel. This is, i'm certain, the earliest one used in the 1800s,
                            with a bunch of. weird shapes, especially the l and g, and the capital letters are
                            a bit bigger and thicker. There's also a shadowed version!

                    <p>This is the second version to be <a href="https://ksaechsstseb.de/farbenseite/post_k.html">made by KPEV in 1906</a>, also made with ruler and compass in a 3x7
                        grid, but much rounder and nicer in my opinion. I like how simple it is, with the semicircles 
                        making some thin connections in letters like the a and h, but this font is kinda crappy in places,
                        like the hole in the A isn't right. Though this standard was the inspiration for the
                        DIN fonts later down the line.

                    <p>During the 1930's (which. coincided with the Nazi regime), the fonts made by KPEV
                        were to be overhauled and made. better. and more legible. The standard that defines
                        the font construction is DIN 1451 and, even though it is in the public domain, it costs
                        a Lot of money to acquire from DIN media. Though people have made their own fonts based
                        on the standard like this one! This is made primarily in a 5x7 grid. The only quibble i have is the square-ish counter shapes
                        when it ideally should be circular. This font also has a slightly bolder version which
                        is better if you wanna replicate an embossed look.

                    <p>This is another version of DIN 1451, here made for engraving into surfaces! It has some
                        differences, especially the 1 and more open e. There were also rounded versions for stuff
                        like CNC and stuff. Also this has a bunch of characters and rounded b and d counters!!!

                    <p>DIN 1451 itself is mostly used for traffic signs in Germany, but also in other countries
                        with different scripts. This font is a dingus DIN clone with cyrillic and greek scripts,
                        as well as a bunch of ligatures as you can see with the ch, though you can turn them off.
                        This is probably my favorite of the DIN fonts, the b and d counters arent as square as Alte DIN,
                        and other stuff isnt too changed from the original standard.

                    <p>Most of the previous fonts have been called 'Mittelschrift' meaning "medium font". This is the
                        other DIN font used nowadays, Engrschift or condensed, using the 3x7 grid like the old
                        Preussische fonts! But this is a version by the
                        <a href="https://portal.dnb.de/bookviewer/view/1169025528#page/10/mode/2up">TGL</a> of East Germany.
                        But it's obviously not the current font used nowadays, bc of the spurless b, but otherwise, it's
                        cool!

                    <p>With the regular and condensed widths, there was also Breitschrift, an extended version
                        using a 7x7 square grid! I like how the capital letters look fitting in a square. But the
                        small letters look. weird. Not very legible, especially for traffic signs, which is 
                        why you don't really see this extended font anymore.
