        <p>You open the door and are greeted by lots of drawers containing cases of movable type, however
            all but one are locked. 
            The smell of wood fills the room. On the wall beside you is an explanatory note.</p>

                Hi there! Welcome to... basically my font shrine. I really like typography, how
                different fonts can look neat, and i've been collecting free fonts for a long time.
                Mostly because. i have nowhere close to the cost of some paid fonts (for a good reason,
                making fonts can be <b>painful</b>), but also because everything should be Free
                as in Freedom yk<br>
                Here are (most of) the fonts i've found, some silly ones, some kinda crap ones, some
                hidden gems, as well as other font sites for you to find more. All the fonts you see on 
                this site btw are free! Here they're accompanied by the people who made the fonts (fonts
                are made! by people!) as well as why i like (ordon't like) it and some neat history. Also, the license!<br>
                <b>ALWAYS READ THE LICENSE!!!</b> Most here use the Open Font License (in super short terms,
                you can use it freely, modify and redistribute it but sometimes you need to change the name, 
                and be credited for your work. please read the 
                <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/">full license</a> for the actual words.).
                Each font is accompanied by its license if it's not the OFL, with a link. If I gave the wrong
                license, gave the wrong credit or any other mistake, <a href="mailto:cvni1981@gmail.com">please tell me!!!</a><br>
                Oh, and the drawers here have a bunch of specimen images, so it may take a while to load
                depending on your bandwidth.<br>
                Enjoy the fonts! 
            </p>

            <h2><a href="https://uncut.wtf/">UNCUT.wtf</a></h2>
                <p>It's a collection of free fonts, some are silly, some are hidden gems. A bunch
                    of the fonts i've found and am showcasing here i found there!</p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a></h2>
            <p>Another big collection of free fonts with tags so it's easy to find one you like. It
                even has the Matcherator, which identifies the font used in an image!</p>

            <h2><a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a></h2>
            <p>It's probably the usual first pick for people looking for free fonts. Not for bad reason,
                lots of language choices (although most are just Noto fonts), as well as icons!
