        <p>These fonts' glyphs all have the same width! These first appeared as necessities for typewriters and
            computer monitors with limited capabilities, and now they're used for writing code and in
            terminal emulators, as well as just. making something look technological.

            <details class="subcategory"><summary><h2>APL fonts</h2></summary>
            <p>APL is a. really old programming language, developed in 1966 and first popularized by IBM with
                their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">System/360 computer systems</a>. And back then,
                cathode ray tubes weren't really a thing, so physical terminals ― basically automated typewriters
                plugged into a computer ― were used for output. And since APL has a bunch of special glyphs, originally
                made by striking 2 characters on top of each other on a typewriter, that represent entire functions,
                APL specific fonts have to be made that have these glyphs, and that also look coherent in the
                context of APL.

                <p>This is a version of the face used in <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/File:APLTypeBall.jpg">the type ball</a>
                    made for terminals like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_2741#APL.5C360">IBM 2741</a> that can type
                    APL characters. Not the best for screen usage but it's super neat and historical. The one shown here specifically
                    is a more expanded version by abrudz of a font originally made by Adrian Smith.

                <p>by <a href="https://apl385.com/">Adrian Smith</a></p><br>

                <p>This font, made by Adrian Smith with APL software vendors in the late 80s,
                    as APL evolved and new characters and interpreters appeared. This has a more
                    rounded, softer look.

                <img src="apl385.png">
                <p>Other (probably better) fonts i recommend are <a href="https://abrudz.github.io/APL386/">APL386</a> by abrudz,
                with some redrawn and new characters, and <a href="https://github.com/dzaima/BQN386">BQN386</a> by dzaima,
                made with another APL-family language in mind, BQN. Again with some redrawn and new glyphs.<br>
                Oh, and also <a href="https://apl385.com/fonts/index.htm">APL333</a> also by Adrian, which is a proportional (non-monospaced)
                version of APL386 if you're into that. These 3 fonts are also public domain and all basically look exactly like the specimen i showed, so i'm not showing them.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Other fonts for APL are in <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Fonts">this article in the APLwiki</a>, some of the fonts
            there also appear in this page.</p>
