        <p>These fonts' glyphs all have the same width! These first appeared as necessities for typewriters and
            computer monitors with limited capabilities, and now they're used for writing code and in
            terminal emulators, as well as just. making something look technological.

                <p>Some of these fonts are great for coding and terminal use! Others really aren't, mostly just
                    for display usage and pretty or interesting looking text. Sorted alphabetically.

                    <p>Azeret is a proportional font family by Displaay, designed to look like something a
                        computer interface could use in the past or future. Looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B">OCR-B</a> kinda.
                        This though is the Mono version, which is free and licensed under the OFL! It has
                        a bunch of idiosyncracies that i think make it look neat and unique: a wide "a" hook, 
                        a small-headed "e" that looks like a serif font and a large x height. I also used to use
                        this in my status.cafe page.

                    <p>Cascadia Code is the default font for Visual Studio Code and Windows Terminal, designed
                        by Microsoft with a bunch of code ligatures and arrows and other characters like icons
                        and stuff. It's variable from Ultra-Light to Bold, with a style set for italics that
                        makes it look like cursive text! I don't really see why that would be good for code but
                        i'm not complaining h<br>
                        It looks very angular, not exactly my thing for codemaking, but it's cool for display.
                        Also this is a moment when a big company makes something open source, so it's cool but yk.
                        It's Microsoft, with their crappy business practices and monopolies and capitalism and that AI Recall
                        thing they almost put in Windows 11. And the entirety of Windows 11.

                    <p>This font actually looks really neat, even though i don't use it often if at all.
                        It has a geometric, circular feel in some letters like P and R, the curved A kinda
                        throws me off. The lowercase characters also look neat, especially the tilted e.

                        of computers. It's also basically the standard font for making screenplay scripts!
                        This though, Courier Prime, is a more refined version that is much easier on the eyes,
                        as well as with real italics unlike the original Courier.

                        The font looks like a general future-y font. Curved corners in some places and the

                        Right angles in other places, semicircular curves which i like, and it only goes from

                    <p>This is the only monospaced font indestructible type has made so far, and it's pretty good.
                        It's meant to replicate the feel of typewriter fonts without being. boring. And it does
                        that pretty well, although the all serifs in the capitals throw me off for some reason. But
                        the italics are very typewriter-y so that's nice.
                        The variable version costs 10 dollars, but the static fonts are already great, and free!

                    <p>This font looks kinda neat for display, not really good for code, but it was designed
                        for constructed languages. It encodes characters for a ton of conscripts like Tengwar,
                        D'ni, Klingon and sitelen pona according to the Under-Conscript Unicode Registry (UCSUR),
                        so it's a pretty big font. It is very geometric bc it's based on the original bitmap Fairfax
                        font, made with a 6x12 grid.

                <p>APL is a. really old programming language, developed in 1966 and first popularized by IBM with
                    their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">System/360 computer systems</a>. And back then,
                    cathode ray tubes weren't really a thing, so physical terminals ― basically automated typewriters
                    plugged into a computer ― were used for output. And since APL has a bunch of special glyphs, originally
                    made by striking 2 characters on top of each other on a typewriter, that represent entire functions,
                    APL specific fonts have to be made that have these glyphs, and that also look coherent in the
                    context of APL.

                        as APL evolved and new characters and interpreters appeared. This has a more
