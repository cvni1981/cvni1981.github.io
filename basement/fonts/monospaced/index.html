        <p>These fonts' glyphs all have the same width! These first appeared as necessities for typewriters and
            computer monitors with limited capabilities, and now they're used for writing code and in
            terminal emulators, as well as just. making something look technological.

                <p>Some of these fonts are great for coding and terminal use! Others really aren't, mostly just
                    for display usage and pretty or interesting looking text. Sorted alphabetically.

                    <p>Azeret is a proportional font family by Displaay, designed to look like something a
                        computer interface could use in the past or future. Looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR-B">OCR-B</a> kinda.
                        This though is the Mono version, which is free and licensed under the OFL! It has
                        a bunch of idiosyncracies that i think make it look neat and unique: a wide "a" hook, 
                        a small-headed "e" that looks like a serif font and a large x height. I also used to use
                        this in my status.cafe page.

                        and stuff. It's variable from Ultra-Light to Bold, with a style set for italics that
                        makes it look like cursive text! I don't really see why that would be good for code but
                        i'm not complaining h<br>
                        It looks very angular, not exactly my thing for codemaking, but it's cool for display.
                        Also this is a moment when a big company makes something open source, so it's cool but yk.
                        It's Microsoft, with their crappy business practices and monopolies and capitalism and that AI Recall

                        It has a geometric, circular feel in some letters like P and R, the curved A kinda
                        throws me off. The lowercase characters also look neat, especially the tilted e.

                        of computers. It's also basically the standard font for making screenplay scripts!
                        This though, Courier Prime, is a more refined version that is much easier on the eyes,
                        as well as with real italics unlike the original Courier.

                        Right angles in other places, semicircular curves which i like, and it only goes from

                    <p>This is the only monospaced font indestructible type has made so far, and it's pretty good.
                        It's meant to replicate the feel of typewriter fonts without being. boring. And it does
                        that pretty well, although the all serifs in the capitals throw me off for some reason. But
                        the italics are very typewriter-y so that's nice.
                        The variable version costs 10 dollars, but the static fonts are already great, and free!

                    <p>This font looks kinda neat for display, not really good for code, but it was designed
                        for constructed languages. It encodes characters for a ton of conscripts like Tengwar,
                        D'ni, Klingon and sitelen pona according to the Under-Conscript Unicode Registry (UCSUR),
                        so it's a pretty big font. It is very geometric bc it's based on the original bitmap Fairfax

                        of handwriting feel in it. I don't really vibe with it, the x height is a bit too
                        tall and the details a bit distracting, like the loop in the k, though you can turn it
                        off with a style set. But i can see myself getting used to this
                        if i wanted to. Does certainly look soft on the eyes.

                    <p>This font is a remake of the iconic system font used in IBM PC's with VGA compatibility, made with a 9x16 grid.
                        Though this one is rounded, which might seem inaccurate, but the original VGA font on a CRT
                        was never perfectly square anyways. And this also looks nicer to the eyes at bigger
                        sizes, with the curves barely noticeable at smaller ones. Also, there are 2 variations, True
                        and False, which makes the "pixels" square or accurate to a CRT, and (437), which only
                        has the characters in the CP437/DOS encoding.

                <p>APL is a. really old programming language, developed in 1966 and first popularized by IBM with
                    their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">System/360 computer systems</a>. And back then,
                    cathode ray tubes weren't really a thing, so physical terminals ― basically automated typewriters
                    plugged into a computer ― were used for output. And since APL has a bunch of special glyphs, originally
                    made by striking 2 characters on top of each other on a typewriter, that represent entire functions,
                    APL specific fonts have to be made that have these glyphs, and that also look coherent in the
                    context of APL.
