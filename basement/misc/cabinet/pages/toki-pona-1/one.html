    <h1>#1: the basics</h1>

    <p>
        Alright! Let's start off with the very absolute basics of saying things in toki pona.
        <br>In super dumb basic terms, a sentence can be divided into 2 (sometimes 3) main bits:</p>
        <ul><li><u class="r">subject</u> (the main actor)<br></li>
            <li><u>predicate</u>:
            <ul><li><u class="y">verb</u> (what the subject is/does)<br></li>
            <li><u class="b">object</u> (what the subject does to)</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Let's see an example in English:
        <br>
        <br><i><u class="r">John</u> <u class="y">eats</u> <u class="b">an apple</u>.</i>
        <br>
        <br>John is the main actor, his action is eating and what he eats is an apple!
        <br>
        <br>(btw, the main order used in English is SVO (subject verb object), but other languages (actually most of them!) may use other orders of things)
        <br>
        <br>In toki pona, it works much the same way (in SVO order too!), but here, the different phrase bits are separated by 2 particles:
        <br>
        <br><span class="tp">󱤧</span>
        <br><i>li</i>: comes before the predicate
        <br>
        <br><span class="tp">󱤉</span>
        <br><i>e</i>: comes before the object (if there is one)
        <br>
        <br>Basically: 
        <br><i<><u class="r">[subject]</u> li <u class="y">[verb]</u> (e <u class="b">[object]</u>)</i>
        <br>
        <br>Since we're just starting, i'll give you some words to start off with, some of them you already know (if you looked at the intro first):<br>
