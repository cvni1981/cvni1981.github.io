                <p>When i originally made the handdrawn/doodles page, as the name suggested, everything was supposed to be handdrawn, even the text. But after trying to chroma key the text+drawings out (because i didn't want an ugly border in the images), 
                once with black on white and then with black on green to see if it helped (it didn't, i suck at chroma key), i just gave up and had to settle for the separated text and drawing.</p>

                <p>since everything else was handdrawn (except for the text), the buttons were also supposed to be handdrawn, but the contrast sucked (especially the etc button) so i scrapped it for pixel-y gifs, and changed the header accordingly.</p>

                <p>Also, during the 5th redesign, i tried to remake the buttons to be much smaller and easier to see, but i couldn't make it work right so i kept the big buttons.</p>

<br>
                        <br>Alright! Let's start off with the very absolute basics of saying things in toki pona.
<br>
                        <br>In super dumb basic terms, a sentence can be divided into 2 (sometimes 3) main bits:
<br>
                        <br>subject (the main actor/object)
                        <br>predicate:
                        <br>verb (what the subject is/does)
                        <br>object (what the subject does to)
<br>
                        <br>Let's see an example in English:
<br>
                        <br>John eats an apple.
                        <br>John is the main actor, his action is eating and what he eats is an apple!
<br>
                        <br>(btw, the main order used in English is SVO (subject verb object), but other languages (actually most of them!) may use other orders of things)
<br>
                        <br>In toki pona, it works much the same way (in SVO order too!), but here, the different phrase bits are separated by 2 particles:
<br>
                        <br>li: comes before the predicate
                        <br>e: comes before the object (if there is one)
<br>
                        <br>Since we're just starting, i'll give you some words to start off with, some of them you already know (if you looked at the intro first):
<br>
                        <br>1 . mi
                        <br>2 . sina
                        <br>3 . ona
                        <br>4 . li
                        <br>5 . e
                        <br>6 . toki
                        <br>7 . pona
                        <br>8 . suli
                        <br>9 . jan
                        <br>10. lape
                        <br>11. ike
                        <br>12. moku
<br>
                        <br>Let's do... I'm eating. How would you say that?
<br>
                        <br>mi li lape?
<br>
                        <br>Actually no, only for mi and sina (when they're on their own) you don't actually use li! It might look like it makes it more ambiguous but it actually works fine.
<br>
                        <br>mi moku.
<br>
                        <br>Also, notice that moku doesn't have any tense. "mi moku" can mean i eat, i ate, i will eat, i have eaten, i am eating, etc etc etc.
                        <br>Again, context will tell you which is right.
<br>
                        <br>Cool! What else?
<br>
                        <br>ona li suli.
<br>
                        <br>They are / It is... Big? Important? Old?
                        <br>Again, context will tell.
<br>
                        <br>What about they are talking?
<br>
                        <br>ona li toki.
<br>
                        <br>Some more examples but with objects this time:
<br>
                        <br>moku li pona e mi.
<br>
                        <br>toki li suli e jan.
<br>
                        <br>Another thing you might have picked up in the intro is how one word can almost act as an adjective and modify the one that comes before it!
                        <br>Actually that's important: the modifier modifies the word(s) that come *before* it, instead of after it, like in english.
<br>
                        <br>Say, "big speech."
<br>
                        <br>You wouldn't say suli toki, that would mean something more like greatness that has to do with speech or smth like that.
<br>
                        <br>toki suli, on the other hand, can mean big speech, or important language or etc.
<br>
                        <br>This is actually how the language's name works!
<br>
                        <br>toki pona means good language or "the language of good". How nice!
<br>
                        <br>I'll talk more about how modifiers work in the next lesson BUT, before i go, some more thingies!
<br>
                        <br>sina pona.
<br>
                        <br>This means "you're good". But you can also use it in a conversation to mean "thank you!"
<br>
                        <br>"Hey, I made some food"
                        <br>"Hey, that tastes real good, great job!"
                        <br>"sina pona!"
<br>
                        <br>"... what"
<br>
                        <br>Another SUPER DUPER important thing to learn in toki pona is this:
<br>
                        <br>jan pona.
<br>
                        <br>It means "good person", but is also the main way to say "friend" in toki pona!
<br>
                        <br>sina jan pona.
                        <br>sina pona!
<br>
                        <br>So... that's it for now.
<br>
                        <br>What??? Already over??
                        <br>C'mon i only learned twelve words :'(

            <p>
                hello there fellow internet enjoyer.
                <br>nice to have you here. very nice in fact.
                <br>it's nice to know that someone has taken the time to explore my place to find this.
                <br>y'know?
<br>
                <br>anyways... where was i, i haven't even started this...
<br>
                <br>just earlier today i had another idea to redesign the site completely, with a black background (again) and this time based on this circular design.
                <br>which gave me anxiety, because it hasn't even been a single month since i redesigned this site for the 5th time, if i'm not mistaken.
                <br>in fact, this reminded me of the whole purpose this site once had: a place for me to make something pretty, no matter how much different or simple or complex it was.
                <br>and... it kinda lives on in the few differently styled pages. but not much.
                <br>and i've questioned whether this whole thing of different pages having different styles was a good idea.
                <br>...even though other sites like nyanseong.neocities.org does this, and very well might i add.
<br>
                <br>i suppose every page has their uniquenesses.
                <br>...uniquenesses. that's a lot of s's.
                <br>*ahem* anyways, this website.
<br>
                <br>it's grown. i don't know really how much it's grown but it has grown.
                <br>and i've never really liked the idea of keeping a blog, probably because i'd forget about it like i've forgotten about this whole website several times...
                <br>but, alongside the circular design idea, i had another idea for a list layout that i realized could work for a blog!
                <br>it's simple and effective.
                <br>i guess that's what this whole site is about, using little simple things and making the most out of them.
                <br>and i don't really know how well that's worked tbh.
<br>
                <br>...what am i even rambling on about...
                <br>i guess this blog should start somewhere, and semicoherent ramblings about this site and others seems like a good place to start.
                <br>one thing that i've learned from making this site is about accessibility.
                <br>i already had miniscule experience with typography but *just* enough to know that some fonts and color combinations are more legible than others.
                <br>some times the legibility has taken a back stand to looks but, overall accessibility is one of the main goals of this site.
<br>
                <br>the moment it hit me straight in the head was mobile compatibility and responsive layouts.
                <br>very very big thanks to natalie for teaching many things about this, but before i didn't know the @media rule, em units, min() and max() and many other things that i'm probably forgetting.
                <br>probably because the way i learned CSS and HTML was just looking up videos and documentation and basically brute force.
                <br>i guess i just like figuring out and doing things myself.
                <br>if it worked, it was good enough, good coding practices be damned.
                <br>mobile just wasn't in my mind when making this site.
                <br>but with the latest redesign i made it mobile-first (mostly), so that it looks at least decent on mobile.
<br>
                <br>i guess that's a strength with simpler layouts, it's more maluable.
                <br>uhm...
                <br>i suppose this is it for now.
                <br>if you want to see more about how this site was made, you can have a look at the misc folder and journal.
                <br>these are the main places where i'll be talking about this site.
                <br>this blog is meant to be about other stuff i like. if i ever feel like talking about it here.
                <br>and i suppose this site is just a place for me to put pretty things i think look nice to the world. maybe someone else likes it too.
<br>
                <br>ok it's time to finish this off. thank you for reading this far!
                <br>have a good day!
<br>
                <br>[also, it's just... kinda sad how probably no one will look at these words, or even the words in the words section of the page!
                <br>well that's a way to kill my motivation instantly...
                <br>but i guess that's how it goes on the net... *sigh*
                <br>people putting effort into something everyone (aside from a few) will just look at once and then never visit again unless having a reason to.
                <br>or maybe not! i don't know how people work.]
